In a world of freelancers, contractors and small, tight development
communities. Everyone is on the public face of their business and
reputation.

We are all constantly marketing something, be it our company or
ourselves in one shape or another. Everything we do matters - your
web-site, your comments in forums, the clothes you wear. It's about the
message we convey in our appearance, our design, our gameplay, our
technology, our ethics and most importantly our interactions with
others. The sooner we realise this the better.
