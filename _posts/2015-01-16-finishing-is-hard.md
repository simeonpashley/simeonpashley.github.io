![Knackered Runner](/assets/img/4633508350_63c6eff451_m.jpg)Every new project
starts out exciting and fun. Then it gets harder and less fun, until it
hits a low point-really hard, and not much fun at all. And then you find
yourself asking if the goal is even worth the hassle.

Are you a finisher?

You're probably at Alpha and the hard work really starts now, it's time
to stop tinkering, tweaking and adding features and it's time to ship
it. Remember, the later in the project you add a feature the more it
costs and the riskier it is. Remember that feature that you added in
Month 1? It's been well and truly tested against everything else in the
game, the new feature you added this morning is just waiting to
explode.
Post Alpha - resist change. Test it, fix it, balance it, polish it and
you're done. Save your ideas for the next one, it'll be bigger and
better anyway.

Send me a link to what you're passionate about, your game, business or
anything! I'd love to know what you're working on.
