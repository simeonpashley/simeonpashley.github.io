description: This week we turn the spotlight on 5 Indie Games Developers. Do you agree? Should you be in this list?
---

The phrase 'indie games' often refers to games made by small independent
developers, who fund the game themselves and release it out into the
wild but self-publishing. After all, they're not bound to a publisher
and therefore independent.

I would also like to remind our readers that the vast majority of games
you buy are made by indie developers but they rarely get the credit they
deserve as their publishers mask their existence in the name of
promoting their own brand.

Here's a list of 5 indie game developers, in no particular order, that
you may have missed on your travels around the world through the likes
of the XNA Creator community or PC developers in general. It's hard to
discover PS3 indies as they're often hidden behind closed doors but I
try.

### ThatGameCompany

#### Journey

ThatGameCompany are making the transition from a small indie game
developer and are in limbo as they only focus on PS3 titles at the
moment. This is a hard path to tread but they appear to be staying true
to their indie roots and delivering emotion and passion in a small
bundle.

### Holographic Dreams

#### Raptor

I came across these Polish indie guys recently and they really struck a
cord with me as they're showing the core indie
traits: passion, commitment and a desire for success. I believe currently have this running as a XNA game (a.k.a. XBox Independent Games), which shows
they're commitment to delivering something beyond a simple browser game.
Here's an early video of a game they're working on right now, take a
look and don't forget to give them feedback!

### Strawdog Studios

#### Space Ark

Strawdog Studios are an indie game developer that I've known for many
years, they're particularly interesting because they have a fantastic
art style that runs through all of their games and they have the
creativity to come up with something new and exciting. I hold them in
high regard and relish an opportunity to work with these talented indie
developers.

Here's their current offering for XBox Live Arcade - Space Ark

> What is Space Ark?
> It's is a fun arcade/puzzle game with a hint of retro arcade flavour;
> inspired by classic arcade games of the late 80s, such as Rainbow
> Island, Bubble Bobble and Arkanoid.
>
> A wandering black hole has damaged a number of planets, rendering them
> uninhabitable. The occupants of the Space Ark (the Arkonauts – a team
> of space traveling animals) are coming to repair the damaged worlds so
> that their refugee inhabitants can return.

### Curve Studios

#### Explodemon

What can I say about the guys at Curve? Jason, Graeme, Jonathan and the
guys (apologies if I've missed anyone) are all legends in their own time
and I've had the great fortune to work with them recently.

Along with the other guys on this list, they epitomise what's great
about indie game developers and I've regularly referenced them as one of
the best developers in the UK because they love games, love making
games, are great to be with, always deliver great work and take me out
to S&M or the Brazilian Meat Factory when I visit. :) Plus, they owe me
a few dinners at PingPong. :P

Here's a quick look at their latest title
Explodemon:

> Explodemon! is a 2.5D action platform game with an explosive main
> character. Mixing classic platforming action - from classics such as
> Mario and MegaMan - with the refined contemporary gameplay of Halo and
> Half-Life 2, it brings old-school gameplay bang up to date. Coming
> from Curve's deep-seated love of video game culture and history,
> Explodemon! is wrapped up as a loving homage to SNES-era Japanese
> action games.
> Explodemon! will release on PlayStation 3 on the PlayStation Network
> in 2010.

### Shadegrown Games

#### Planck

I hooked up with these guys on Twitter recently and I really liked the
potential of what they had on their web-site so I'll be keeping a close
eye on these guys. You should check out their blog as the IGF judges
also think they're great.

> Planck is an upcoming music-based experiment which looks to play out
> in a similar fashion to Audiosurf, but with different core elements.
> Enemies litter your path, and destroying enough of them unlocks a new
> instrument for the current song.
>
> The game doesn't use your own music - rather, it pieces together a
> specifically-created soundtrack in a Auditorium-esque manner. You can
> also jump between sections of the track to mix different sounds and
> change the music how you see fit.
>
> Looks mighty interesting. No release date or platform set as of yet.

### Summary

Well, I've enjoyed this round up of indie game developers and all of
their indie cuteness. I hope you show them some appreciation by dropping
by to give them your feedback on their web-sites and 'official' YouTube,
or even in our comments as I'm sure they'll be reading.

Is there someone you think should be in the spotlight? Let me know in
the comments.
