![](/assets/img/iphone_ra.jpg "iPhone view of Ring Alpha")Mobile purchases
and mobile web viewing are increasing every day and it's simply not good
enough to expect users to view your regular site. iPhone, Android and
tablet viewers expect custom built views.

Thankfully, all of our regular and content-managed websites **take full
advantage of the iPhone, iPad, Android and other devices** with views
and touch-based interfaces especially built to get the most out of them.

Our new elegant iPad specific view is a joy to behold and features large
buttons, swipe gestures and much more.

**Can you afford not to have a mobile website?** Especially a **FREE**
version of your existing site?
