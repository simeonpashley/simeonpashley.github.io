I'd like to share with you my game development career experience as part
of a series of posts, let's rejoin the story at during the twilight days
of PlayStation 2 when I started at Kuju in Sheffield. I've included a
lot of photos in this post so you may even make an appearance!

### Kuju Sheffield v1

![](assets/Sheffield-Studio-January-2003-150x150.jpg "Sheffield Studio, January 2003")I
was fortunate to be have formed strong relationships with people across
the industry and I was brought in as employee \#2 for the newly formed
Kuju studio in Sheffield where the next phase of my career began
including many of the people I'd worked with in Leeds on the emerging
platforms.

Kuju had recently been listed on the stock market and was expanding
rapidly with studios in Guildford, London, Brighton and now Sheffield.

Starting out at Kuju Sheffield was an exciting time, there were
essentially 4 of us in the 1st few weeks holed up inside a tiny office
under one of the stands of the football stadium for Sheffield United.
The room was long and thin with only a high tiny window at one end and
it was very reminiscent of the early days of my career back at Alligata.

In this tiny space we not only crammed ourselves but an immense server
rack that was built for the future, the server itself was incredibly
noisy and it appeared to be made even more so by the small environment.
The room soon became hot and noisy but we were enjoying ourselves.

Dave, Nick, Tony and myself beavered away making a few PS2/X360/PC ports
for the main Kuju office while we found our feet and got our own
projects, which didn't take long and we were expanding quickly.

**Kuju Sheffield v1.1**\
 Within a few weeks we expanded into a larger office on the same floor
that took us up to about 15 people before we needed to move again. We
were working on a football game for Codemasters at this point and we
started to bring in some great staff who were unfortunate casualties of
the demise of Warthog studios. It would turn out that we'd stay together
for many years and we had a great time.

Working under a football stadium posed its own challenges with the most
prominent one being that we weren't allowed in the building during a
period of 2hrs before to 2hrs after a match! This was particularly
frustrating when we had deadlines to hit as we were simply evacuated
from the building. As producer/project manager, I even went to the
extent of planning the milestones to avoid home match days.

The servers furiously buzzed away in the corner and we delivered the
game on time and this won us another contract.

I was named as Technical Director at this point but I was pretty much
doing anything that needed to be
done: building desks, installing
cabling, running servers, finance, business development, training,
project management, programming and a load of other stuff. All the stuff
everyone does in a small business and it was fun.

We delivered the game on PS2 and XBox as a team and we were hungry for
me but we really need to move out so we relocated across town into the
posh Media Center.

-   **Date**: 2003
-   **Role**: Anything going
-   **Studio Size:** 10-15
-   ****Projects**:** 1
-   **Platforms**: PlayStation 2, XBox, PC

**Kuju Sheffield v1.2**\
 ![](assets/sheffield_office-150x150.jpg "sheffield_office")Our studio
increased quickly over the next few years peaking at about 40 staff
across 3 projects being made on PC, PSP, Xbox & PS2.

We had specialist staff now and we started to get some real traction.

We were making a Flight Simulator for PSP, Football Action game for
console, Football Management game for PC, Social Quiz game for PS2,
Fitness game connected to a cross-trainer, TV\<>game cross-over pilot
and lots of little trinkets on the side.

People came and went but we remained pretty stable and everyone appeared
to be enjoying themselves.

My named role as Tech Director was now largely being done by one of our
original lead programmers where I was pretty much acting as Dev
Director, setting out production process, managing finance, working
across sites and a myriad of other things.

I attended frequent meetings with the Execs at Kuju presenting projects,
new business and finance reports all of which I'd prepared and ran. I
had good relationships with our clients as I was their day-to-day
contact.

I was also getting more involved in the people side of the business
again, hiring, firing, reviewing and applying the regular attention that
an active group of developers required.

Despite all of this, we were struggling to get in new work along with
many other developers and the prospects didn't look good.

-   **Date**: 2005
-   **Role**: Anything going
-   **Studio Size:** 15-35
-   ****Projects**:** 3
-   **Platforms**: PlayStation 2, XBox, PC

**Kuju v2.0 - The King is Dead**\
 ![](assets/IMG_4287-150x150.jpg "1st World War devs")What happened next
was a blur of rapid change.

Our incumbent Studio Manager retired and I was asked to take over as I'd
been doing a large part of the work anyway. It didn't feel like much of
a change for these reasons and I relished the opportunity to take the
studio forwards.

I made a promise to
everyone: I would take us into a new era and get us a 'next-gen' project, we would do this by standing on the shoulders of Unreal 3. We would develop expertise in this area that would benefit us
all.

Numerous people shifted around within the studio, backfilling all the
positions and this gave everyone a new round of energy.

I worked hard over a few months and I got us another contract - this
time it was significant as it was on 'next-gen' consoles and represented
a massive improvement in our prospects. We all relished the opportunity.

We began work on our game, really pushing ourselves and learning new
platforms and new ways of working.

![](assets/Resize-of-100_1352-150x150.jpg "Running Out Of Space")We
rapidly ran out of space and we outgrew our offices where the main
problem was that our expansion had caused us to take on additional,
separate, offices in the same building. This was workable previously as
we'd been split across 3 games in 3 offices so it kinda worked but it
failed when all of us were on 1 project.

In hindsight, this is a great way to scale up. Take on multiple small
projects then combine your team to make a larger team for a single
project.

So, I hunted around for a new home for our studio and I found one just
around the corner.

-   **Date**: 2005
-   **Role**: Anything going
-   **Studio Size:** 30-35
-   ****Projects**:** 1
-   **Platforms**: PlayStation 2, XBox, PC

**Kuju v2.1 - Custom Fit Office**\
 ![](assets/Arundel_SmileyChris1-150x150.jpg "Smiley Chris")Our new
offices was brilliant. I managed to find us a large open-plan space and
I planned the floor space incorporating meeting rooms, a small office
(for me), storage space, kitchen and other bits and bobs. We got to
choose the colour scheme, flooring and everything! Of course I can't
claim sole ownership of all of this.

Our Art Director, Nick, and Tech Director, Dino, and many other people
played a key role in making this a success.

It took a few weeks to come together and we were so excited to be
moving, even it if was just around the corner.

I think it's safe to say that we enjoyed our new space.

[![](assets/fire1_470x365-150x150.jpg "fire1_470x365")](http://game-linchpin.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/fire1_470x365.jpg)We had exciting times too, we had people trapped in a lift and had to call out the fire brigade that amused everyone except those trapped and we there was also a MASSIVE fire opposite our building and we just watched from our windows.

During all of this we were still working on our game and all of our
other commitments but it all seemed to gel.

I structured the studio to be as agile as possible and we started to
invade the new territory of Outsourcing the artwork that very few people
were doing at the time. It just made complete sense.

**Meeting the Stars**\
 Our football game was a dream come true for a handful of us as we went
to Barcelona and Milan to go behind the scenes of the largest clubs at
Barcelona, Inter Milan and AC Milan to capture reference of the stars.
 From all 3 teams we got to meet all the stars, agents and managers,
take detailed reference photos of everyone from many angles. We even
went out for dinner with [Lionel
Messi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi)!

### Kuju v3.0 - becoming Chemistry

![](assets/chem1-235x300.jpg "chem1")The higher-level business was going
through a transition. The many Kuju studios in London, 2 in Guildford,
Sheffield and Brighton all had their own niche and identity and it was
becoming increasingly confusing for us internally and it also must have
been very strange for our prospective clients. We would attend meetings
and say "Hi, we're from Kuju and..." .... "Didn't we just see you guys?"
... "No, that must have been one of our other studios...we specialise in
X and would like to show you Y". etc.

Re-branding was the order of the day, Brighton went first and became Zoe
Mode and we followed on quickly afterwards changing our name to
Chemistry.

The name Chemistry worked for us, it represented us bringing together
different elements of a game and making something new and never
experienced before. It solidified our messaging and provided a great
identity for us as a studio to get behind. We had banners, marketing,
press, t-shirts and a whole range of other things branded up. Our
offices were white, clean, sterile with a few hints of colour.

![](assets/Bafta1.jpg "Bafta1")Back on the floor, I'd also been pushing
new contracts and we were now working on 3 separate PS3 and X360 games.
We had an FPS, a Football game and we were also helping Midway out on
one of their projects.

As a studio, we were immensely busy and the amount of personal work was
stacking up plus I was aiming to keep everything on an even keel.

Due to the nature of working as a remote office, as well as running 3
next-gen projects and running a studio I was left also doing Office
management, HR, finance, answering the phones, ordering toilet rolls,
managing servers, doing the post, fixing desktop systems, building
furniture among other things.

As management, there was myself and 1 other Project Manager doing all of
this together. You can imagine what this did to me as a result.

![](assets/ChemistryTeam_Feb2008-300x199.jpg "ChemistryTeam_Feb2008")

-   **Date**: 2007
-   **Role**: Anything going
-   **Studio Size:** 35-40
-   ****Projects**:** 3
-   **Platforms**: PlayStation 3, XBox 360, PC

### Enough is enough

[![](assets/Mikey1-150x150.jpg "Leaving the studio in good hands")](http://game-linchpin.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Mikey1.jpg)Despite great prospects and a wonderful team, I'd had enough and I worked with the Execs to bring in Mike as a replacement Studio Head and I sadly quickly left the business with nowhere else to go. These were tough times and sometimes people just won't listen to repeated cries for support and see the issues that are staring them right in the face. It sometimes takes a drastic measure to make people realise what's going
off.

So, I left Kuju and a great team. My time at Kuju was the happiest and
most complete I'd ever felt and it felt like I'd let a lot of people
down but I had to move on.

### What next? Across to the dark side

The next phase of my career was completely unknown and it took me a few
months to find a role that suited me. I was fortunate to have 2 great
offers: 1 from Codemasters, 1 from Sony. Which one did I take?

This is where we'll join the story next time...
