<p>In order to compete in today's tough hospitality economy, business owners need a strong online presence. The convenience of online shopping, coupled with the high price of gasoline, means a growing number of potential customers are on the Internet right now looking for your business and dreaming of their next vacation destination. So, whether you are just beginning to sell online or want a more competitive edge for your existing business, knowing how to choose the best website designer is a crucial skill.</p>
<p>One word of caution: when choosing the best designer for your business, never choose based on price alone. While price can be one indicator of whether the designer meets your budget needs, you may unfortunately get what you pay for, which will certainly cost you more in the long run. Hire the best designer you can afford to avoid this common and expensive mistake.</p>
<p>Of course, paying top dollar does not guarantee you’ll get the best designer either. So let’s consider the top 5 qualities to look for in choosing the best website designer for your business:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Professionalism</li>
<li>Portfolio</li>
<li>Experience</li>
<li>Creativity</li>
<li>Service</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Professionalism</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately, all website designers can create graphic design for your business website, but not all are professionals. Professionalism seems to be fading as more and more website designers jump on the freelance bandwagon to get their share of the buying public’s money. Simply claiming to be the best is not good enough.  Doesn’t everyone claim they provide the best services at the best prices? So pay close attention to other important signs, including:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Is the business web design company interested in specifically what elements you’ll need on your website for growth, or are you herded into their client group and given a select number of templates to choose from that look like everyone else’s?</li>
<li>Is the business web designer prepared to take the time to determine your target audience?</li>
<li>Are they interested in your overall business goals?</li>
<li>Does the designer know enough about your industry, or are they willing to learn, in order to trounce the competition?</li>
<li>IS the design company responsive when you call or send an e-mail? If it takes 2 days for them to return your call just to discuss the project, what will happen after they’ve gotten your money?</li>
<li>Does the designer talk in terms of the future- how they will support your needs or continue to work with and maintain your business website once is completed?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Portfolio</strong></p>
<p>Basically, a picture does speak a thousand words. The best website designers will have a portfolio of successful sites.  So ask questions. Seek references. Visit websites they’ve created. Notice the page ranking with the search engines.</p>
<p><strong>Experience</strong></p>
<p>In essence, the best web designer has the experience necessary to make the competition pale in comparison. With an in-depth know of SEO (search engine optimisation) and other marketing strategies, a growing knowledge base to stay one step ahead, and the focused expertise to increase you Internet presence, your online visitor will be converted into an online buyer.</p>
<p><strong>Creativity</strong></p>
<p>Templates are a dime a dozen.  Actually, a growing number are freeware. A novice can take a pre-made web page and, with limited knowledge, build a website. Thus the end result looks like a thousand other sites scattered throughout the Internet.  To be number one, you must look like number one visually, with concise information, consumer-friendly interactive navigation, stunning pictures and enticing content that sells.</p>
<p><strong>Service</strong></p>
<p>Probably the most import aspect of the best website designer is service.  A good designer will back up his/her product with ongoing services to ensure your success.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Unique Web Design-</strong>updated periodically</li>
<li><strong>Web Hosting</strong>-to keep the site up and running</li>
