Over the years I've found that RSS feeds have made it easier for me to
keep up the latest news in my reading list. I have a carefully
cultivated list of 200+ home & work related feeds that I patrol every
day. Here's how to import my list for your own use.

<div>

The imminent demise of Google Reader on 1st June 2013 has prompted me to
find an alternative reader. To be safe I exported my reading list in
[OPML format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPML)so I could take it with me (linked to this post).

</div>

How can I use your reading list?
--------------------------------

Since most RSS readers sync with *Google Reader* you can use that as a
way to get the feed setup. After which you can sync it with your
favourite reader of choice

Here's a quick way to use my feeds as a starting point:

1.  Download my reading list in OPML format - <http://db.tt/Sad7oSAT>
2.  Open *Google Reader* - <http://www.google.co.uk/reader>
3.  Go to *Reader Settings* (via the little cog at the top right of the
    *Google Reader* window)
4.  Find the *Import/Export* tab in settings, then import my OPML file
    you downloaded earlier

### <span style="font-size: 1.17em;">Why Feedly?</span>

<div>

<div>

After much investigation I chose [Feedly](http://www.feedly.com/) as my weapon of choice.

</div>

Feedly gives me everything I need for my reading list between browser &
mobile in a clean, elegant way. *Feedly* enables me to send posts to
*Pocket* too where I can read & share them at my leisure. I often patrol
the headlines and my iPhone and then send interesting posts to *Pocket*
where I can read them in comfort on my laptop or tablet.

**How do I import into Feedly?**

</div>

<div>

It really couldn't be simpler as you don't have to import anything!

</div>

<div>

1.  Go to *Feedly*, register and connect to your account to *Google
    Reader* -  <http://www.feedly.com/>
2.  *Feedly* will import all the feeds

</div>



<div>

That's it. **Stick with *Feedly*** as it supports 'Send to **Pocket**'

</div>



<div>

Obviously my feeds will only get you started as there's probably a lot
of stuff in there you're never going to read but it's a start. :)

</div>



<div>

You can also install a *Feedly* plugin for
[Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/feedly/) &
[Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/feedly-your-news-rss-goog/hipbfijinpcgfogaopmgehiegacbhmob?hl=en) that makes curating your feeds ever so easy.

</div>



<div>

**Boom!** You now have an awesome easy way to keep up-to-date with
everything that's going on around your favourite websites.
