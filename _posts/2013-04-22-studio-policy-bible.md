Every business needs some policies to keep teams aware of everything
they need to know and working smoothly. Here's one of our old policy
documents that's a little skewed towards a game development studio but
most of it should apply to most types of business

A central repository for all the bits of miscellaneous policy staff
should be aware
of:

manager chain before final approval/rejection when they are sent to HR. 
Project Managers may finally approve all holiday forms themselves,

1 week in which case Exec Producer approval is still required.

1.4.  All recruitment forms should pass up the line manager chain before
final approval/rejection by the Studio Head
