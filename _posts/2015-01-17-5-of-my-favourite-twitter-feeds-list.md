Here at @GameFreelancing, we use Twitter to connect with the game
freelancing community and really get to grips with what's going off from
all aspects and distil it down into items our readers will find useful.
We select the cream of gaming, developers, business and freelancing
tweets and send them straight to you. [Follow us to keep
up](http://twitter.com/gamefreelancing).

We've listed here the ones we've found the most interesting this week
and definitely worth following. Don't forget to mention @GameFreelancing
!

**1. @milkstone** - A great Spanish Independent Game Development studio
that's launched it's new iPhone title this week and also produces some
great tweets about being an independent developer. One to watch.

**2. @ericries** - Eric is the originator of the phrase "Minimum Viable
Product" and he also talks about starting a business in a 'lean' way,
which always makes for an interesting read and something I'll be
covering more about here on @GameFreelancing .

**3. @ThisIsSethsBlog** - the blog of popular author Seth Godin has his
finger on the pulse of promotion and connecting with your audience thats
appropriate in many ways, such as how to talk to your game audience, how
expectations change, how marketing has changed. It's often a thought
provoking and inspiring read.

**4. @Michael_French** - Michael is on the bleeding edge of video game
industry news as his position as the Editor-in-Chief of Video game
industry news web-sites [Develop](http://www.develop-online.net/),
[MCV](http://www.mcvuk.com/) and
[CasualGaming.biz](http://www.casualgaming.biz/) means he often gives clues as to some breaking news well before it hits the press.

**5. @allvideogames** - Lester writes about gaming from an interesting
perspective and often uncovers things that go missing from the more
popular news feeds. As such, it's worth a follow.
