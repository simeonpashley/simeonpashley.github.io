title: Relocating to Github.io
---

I recently chose to take up the challenge of using github.io to host my long-standing blog.

As I write, I've hopefully move all of my old posts over to Jekyll Markdown format by the magic of some scripts, some regex search & replace and some sheer effort.

There's a few missing edges but I'm hopeful that keeping the content in Markdown format will mean I don't have to go through this pain again.

Some of the images didn't make it through the process so I'll be churning through those in the coming days.

Issues to solve:
- Missing images
- Random post dates & times
- Formatting/style issues lost in translation (Tables are going to be fun!)
