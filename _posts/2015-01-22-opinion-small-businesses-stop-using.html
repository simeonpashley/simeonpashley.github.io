<p>If there's one thing I hate, it's receiving an automated reply from a small business, in particular one that's supposed to connect with me as a person. OK, I'll confess I'm having a rant about recruitment agencies, which is a pretty dangerous thing to do when you're looking for work.</p>
<p>I have a special hatred for ones that pretend to be from a person. <b>I know you're not there</b> due to the nature and content of your email so the "personal touch" is just lost. There's no name, there's nothing.</p>
<p>Also, <b>PLEASE don't direct me to a web-site to fill in my details</b>. If you're too busy to even bother to talk to me in the first place and find out about me then I know for definite you won't "process" my CV in a meaningful way and you&nbsp;definitely won't find me something that's relevant.</p>
<p>There's one fundamental point, <b>I know you only get paid when I find a job</b>! In the modern world I have many means of finding work <b>but</b>&nbsp;I recognise that the recruitment role is important and can make a real difference.</p>
<p>My point is, <b>there are recruiters out there who maintain the personal touch</b> and they succeed and get my vote every time.</p>
<p>When I get back to recruiting, which I will, I will absolutely focus on the agencies who I had the best experience with from both sides.</p>
<p>Make it personal, make the candidate feel like you have their best interests at heart and you're not just looking &nbsp;for your next 10%.</p>
<p>What's your experience been like? Recommendations? Story to tell? Keep in touch.</p>
