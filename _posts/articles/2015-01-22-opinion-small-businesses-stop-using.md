If there's one thing I hate, it's receiving an automated reply from a
small business, in particular one that's supposed to connect with me as
a person. OK, I'll confess I'm having a rant about recruitment agencies,
which is a pretty dangerous thing to do when you're looking for work.

I have a special hatred for ones that pretend to be from a person. **I
know you're not there** due to the nature and content of your email so
the "personal touch" is just lost. There's no name, there's nothing.

Also, **PLEASE don't direct me to a web-site to fill in my details**. If
you're too busy to even bother to talk to me in the first place and find
out about me then I know for definite you won't "process" my CV in a
meaningful way and you definitely won't find me something that's
relevant.

There's one fundamental point, **I know you only get paid when I find a
job**! In the modern world I have many means of finding work **but** I
recognise that the recruitment role is important and can make a real
difference.

My point is, **there are recruiters out there who maintain the personal
touch** and they succeed and get my vote every time.

When I get back to recruiting, which I will, I will absolutely focus on
the agencies who I had the best experience with from both sides.

Make it personal, make the candidate feel like you have their best
interests at heart and you're not just looking  for your next 10%.

What's your experience been like? Recommendations? Story to tell? Keep
in touch.
