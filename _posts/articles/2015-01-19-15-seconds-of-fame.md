"In the future, everyone will be world-famous for 15 minutes." - Andy
Warhol, 1968

Time has become compressed, 15 minutes is a long time now. Move fast or
get left behind.

The take away here is that everything has a much shorter lifetime now.
Recognise that your job won't be for life, your game will be forgotten
within 2 months of launch, 10hrs of gameplay is a lifetime, even the
massive investment in a typically massively multiplayer online game will
only last 3 years.Â

Things change rapidly and you need to be prepared with your next
successful venture, always think ahead, always expect change, never be
complacent.
