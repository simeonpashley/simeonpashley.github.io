Carbon Copy Cloner - micro review

[Carbon Copy Cloner](http://www.bombich.com/) a.k.a. *CCC* is a
donation-ware disk duplication application for Apple Mac OSX. I recently
used the app to successfully move my data from a HDD to an SDD and I
decided to give it a go as part of my regular backup system. Here’s my
mini review…

My gripe with the app is that while the scheduled events do start on
time, even waking the computer up to do so, the app *doesn’t* keep the
system awake. This means that your power settings are likely to cause
your system to sleep and therefore the backup to pause in the middle.
This of course means that it will resume when your computer wakes again
and that will most likely be when you get back on your system in the
morning to start work and be faced with the rest of the backup job.

Further to this last point, if you have ‘sleep when done’ as a setting
then it will do just that. Good in one sense **but** not good when it’s
resumed because you’ve woken it up and you’re in the middle of some work
and then your system just drops to sleep. I appreciate this is as
designed but the app should recognise *who* woke the system up and only
sleep if it woke it up.

Summary
-------

On the whole, it’s a great *free* disk duplication software for OSX with
a few gripes related to scheduled backups that can be worked around.
