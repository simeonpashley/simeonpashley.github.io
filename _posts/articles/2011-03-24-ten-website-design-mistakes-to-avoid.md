As the economy took a downturn and fuel prices soar, more people are
turning to spending money online. But, with millions of sites competing
for every customer, competition is tough, to say the least. To
complicate matters, studies show that the average website visitor spends
approximately 8 seconds on your site before moving onto check out your
competition…unless your product or service hits ‘em right between the
eyes with the kind of impact that makes them want to stay and buy.

To stand head and shoulders above the competition, you should know these
ten business website design mistakes to avoid. With only a few seconds
to convert browsing visitors into paying customers, striving to become
the first --and best --destination for your products and services will
be much easier if you follow these key
points:

-   Using Design Templates
-   Dull, Drab Colors and Words
-   Too Many Words
-   Confusing Menus
-   Inaccessibility; Poor Navigation
-   Lack of Professional Appearance
-   Hard to Read, Frustrating Fonts
-   Only One Purchase Option
-   Neglecting Upkeep & Site Maintenance
-   Annoying Ads, Pop-Up and Otherwise

Looking over this list, you’ll notice all of these points fall under
three main points vital to your business website design
success:

-   Presentation
-   Precision
-   Prioritisation

Presentation
------------

The main goal of any profitable business website is to attract potential
customers and convert them into paying customers.  Thus, presentation is
vital to the appeal of your website. Grab ‘em while you got ‘em, or risk
losing them to your competitors. It’s that simple. The best business
websites combine great design with the features customers want most, to
get their attention, draw them in closer and open their wallets.

Precision
---------

Have you ever landed on a site where the home page has ten paragraphs of
detailed information in a teensy-tiny font you can barely see? How long
did you hang around? Do you remember what they sold? Better still, did
you buy anything?

Wordiness, confusing navigation, poor quality images, insufficient
explanations of who you are and what you offer are just a few of the
problems web sites often encounter. Here’s the
problem: Most website owners create the site based on what they *think* people want to know, not what people *really* want to know. They miss the mark in serving the needs of their customers, and it can mean death for their business.

Uncover your customer’s real needs so you can precisely address those
needs via the design and features of your business website. That’s a
sure path to success.

Prioritisation
--------------

Finally, no business is successful without prioritization.  For example,
the needs of a customer should come first.  When a question or problem
arises, can you be reached for customer service, or are you
unreachable?  Does your business website design make it super-easy for
people to contact you for help, or do they have to hunt all over the
site to find your phone number or email address? If you make your
customers feel as though you’re happy to take their money quickly, but
not so quick to respond to questions and problems, your low conversions
and high bounce rates will show your website’s true colors.

Likewise, if a visitor is sitting in front of the computer, open wallet
in hand, is your sales process simplified? Does it offer several payment
options? Is the product or service up-to-date? A customer friendly
business website, where the buyer feels he/she is a priority, means
repeat patronage in the future.

functional business website customers will love, and to avoid theses
common mistakes and others, knock the socks off your competition with a
