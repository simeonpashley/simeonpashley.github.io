### **Yes. Now.**

I am an artist. • I take initiative • I do the work, not the job. •
Without critics, there is no art. • <span style="color: #993300;">**I am a Linchpin. I am not easily replaced**</span>**.** • If it’s never been done before, even better. • The work is personal, too important to phone
in.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>• The lizard brain is powerless in the face of art. • I make it happen. Every day. • <span
style="color: #ff9900;">**Every interaction is an opportunity to make a
connection**</span>**.**<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>• The past is gone. It has no power. The future depends on choices I make now.
• I own the means of production—the system isn’t as important as my
contribution to it. • I see the essential truth unclouded by worldview,
and that truth drives my decisions. • I lean into the work, not away
from it. <span style="color: #99cc00;">**Trivial work doesn’t require
leaning.**</span> • Busywork is too easy. Rule-breaking works better and
is worth the effort. • Energy is contagious. The more I put in, the more
the world gives back. • It doesn’t matter if I’m always right. It
matters that *<span style="color: #33cccc;">I’m always moving</span>*. • I raise the bar. I know yesterday’s innovation is today’s standard. • I will not be brainwashed into believing in the status quo. •<span
style="color: #008080;"> **Artists don’t care about credit. We care about change.**</span> • There is no resistance if I don’t allow it to defeat me. • I embrace a lack of structure to find a new path. • I am
surprising. (And often surprised). • I donate energy and risk to the
cause. • I turn charisma into leadership. • The work matters. • <span
style="color: #ff6600;">**Go. Make something happen.**</span>
