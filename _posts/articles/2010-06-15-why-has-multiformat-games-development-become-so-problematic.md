...are the opening lines from an this old video game production article
I contributed to a few years for [Develop
Mag](http://www.develop-online.net/) about video game production issues.

*"Mike Cook" is actually Game Production Legend "[Mike
Cox](http://uk.linkedin.com/pub/mike-cox/2/55a/584)" as the author got his name wrong.* :)

Read the full article below, including me waffling on about
multi-platform video game development.

> needed more now than ever before. Similarly, though, with the large

> platform-specific quirks and similarly more money. But is it getting
> to a point where the benefit gained from going cross-platform is
> actually being outweighed by the cost – and is being a multiplatform
> developer really as hard as some say?

> At first glance, it is clear that the very definition of
> ‘multiplatform’ is muddier than it ever was. While it could have
> previously been easily defined as the development of a similar-looking
> title on all of the ‘big three’s’ platforms, Nintendo’s decision to
> veer from the road of horsepower advancement and produce a largely
> last-generation specced machine has changed the playing field.

> Similarly, with the PlayStation 2 enjoying a long tail in sales that
> none of its contemporaries managed, there’s much to be said for
> developing on last-generation machines. And let’s not forget the two
> wildly different handhelds while we’re at it, and the player interface
> differences that the Wii and DS bring to the table. Suddenly,
> ‘multiformat’ encompasses a set of vastly different standards of
> dizzying complexity. Or, as Eidos’ chief technology officer Julien
> Merceron thinks of it, possibilities.

> might only target PC, Xbox 360 and PS3, and that’s not hugely
> difficult.
>
> “The other case is that, if you're making a mainstream game, you’d
> ideally like to support the Wii as well. In that situation, developing
> for the Wii in addition to the other formats isn’t the easiest thing
> in the world – especially when each version needs to be cutting edge
> on their respective platform.”
>
> One way of reducing the complexity of the latter case, says Merceron,
> is to actually open up to even more platforms. That way, “you could
> potentially develop three sets of
titles: one for PC/PS3/360, one for
> Wii/PS2/PSP and one for DS and mobile,” he says.
>
> CAUGHT IN THE NET

> When taking a birds-eye view of the different ‘this generation’
> consoles, it’s tempting to generalise the differences based solely on
>
performance: the Wii is weak, the PS3 is strong but the Cell poses
> architectural difficulties, and the Xbox 360 is powerful and less of
> an alien layout. But to do so would miss some of the other large
> issues, especially one such as online gameplay.

> development – “We’ve got Epic worrying about the technology, so we can
> be worrying about other things,” says managing director Mike Cook – as
> studio manager Simeon Pashley explains, there are still significant
> issues to be worked around.**
>

> Live, PlayStation Network and GameSpy or whatever other PC service you
> use.”**
>
> As such, part of the network implementation focuses on just getting

> REAL PROBLEMS
>
> Interestingly, Unreal Engine 3 has in some ways become the poster

> engine and has been epitomised by creator Epic’s own Gears of War but

> “Epic have done a lot of work on PS3 version of Unreal,” explains
> Cook. “The engine was obviously PC and Xbox-lead, by a long way, but I

> of Unreal up to where it should be. It certainly looks the part.”

> Naturally, Mark Rein is confident about Unreal Tournament 3’s

> production of one of Epic’s own games to get UE3 to ship quality.
> “Like we did last year with Gears of War on the 360, we’re kind of

> development for multiple platforms. The alternative – building

> medium-sized developers.
>  Merceron points out several reasons for why building a bespoke

bigger: even console games are moving
> deeply into the online and social community spaces, an area where
> multiplatform needs to be applicable as well,” he adds.

> “It’s correct that there’s a lot of bespoke or tailored code,

> but it’s definitely the case that when it comes to aspects like
> multithreading we’ve got an awful lot of common code,” says Alex
> McLean, technical director at Pivotal, which itself has spent the past
> year building its own unified development base for 360, PS3 and PC. As
> such, it’s important to make sure you have a solid underlying
> structure that’s applicable across all of the platforms, so that
> platform-specific features can be abstracted out on top.

> It’s a point that Merceron agrees
with: “Whatever your approach,
> anyone can trip up on architectural aspects. Architecture work is now
> extremely important so that you ensure the implementation will be
> robust and manageable. A poor low level architecture will generate a
> lot of multiplatform issues when designing the high level features.”
>
> Part of the problem that developers have had adopting to the high-end
> machines of late has been that of concurrency, the true power only
> obtainable when all of the cores or SPUs are working efficiently. As
> such, splitting big processes into smaller tasks and building a
> super-scheduler to manage them is a major priority for developers
> starting out.
>
> “The SPUs are incredibly hard to program and optimise for,” empathises
> Valery Carpentier, Emergent’s EMEA field application engineer. “You

> to transfer memory yourself – it’s a big nightmare.”

> It’s a problem that Emergent saw coming early – not just that of
> programming for the PS3’s unbalanced concurrent architecture, but
> developers having to plan how their game will work on anywhere from
> one processor to six. As a reaction, it developed Floodgate, a new but
> integral part of its Gamebryo engine aimed at helping game studios get
> the most performance out of parallel systems. Although it could be
> (somewhat unfairly) described as a scheduler, Floodgate is in
> actuality a system that manages processes running on different cores,
> keeping them thread-safe and their memory managed effectively – and
> scales from the six core PS3 through the Xbox 360 and even the Wii.
>
> “When you’ve written the task program, you can tell Floodgate to run
> it on one SPU, two SPUs or even all five. It’s as simple as that – you
> just say ‘run this task on this many SPUs’ and it will.”
>
> These ‘Floodgate programs’ can be written in pure C++ to ensure
> cross-platform compatibility and then later rewritten in chip-specific
> assembler during the optimisation stage. The benefit of Floodgate,
> says Carpentier, is that it allows people to get code running on
> multiple processors quickly – and that time saving, which Emergent
> says can amount to around 12 man-months, can be better spent
> optimising, swapping tasks between cores or altering how many cores
> are working on the task.

> that’s where you win. Assets that you build are usable on multiple
> platforms. So long as you don’t do something like 360 and DS, the

> always been a hard selling point for our technology,” he says.

> probably does make us better equipped – especially as these new
> systems, the 360 and PS3, are very similar in nature to high-end PCs
> in terms of some of the parts that they’re using. So it’s important to
> remember that we had this problem already on PC in a much larger way
> than we did on the consoles.”
