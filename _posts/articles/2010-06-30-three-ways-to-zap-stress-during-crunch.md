Stress is a fact of 21st-century life, and all the more so when you're
working on big, high-pressure projects. I've worked in a projects
environment for most of the past 20 years, and I know how it gets. You
start to become irritable, forgetful, you may find yourself dreaming
about work, you're tired but you can't sleep well, you might even start
to find loud noises and bright lights painful. It's not fun.

 Basically, what's happened is that what is meant to be a short-term
response for getting you out of immediate physical danger, increasing
your concentration and memory and awareness of your environment, has
kept firing off over a long period, and now those exact responses are
getting worn out - as if you'd kept lifting a weight with the same hand,
over and over, until your muscles get fatigued and stop working
properly.

So what can you do? On the principle that a problem well defined is half
solved, let's start with a definition of stress.

### What Stress Is

This is my simplified version of the Kim-Diamond definition (in *Nature
Reviews Neuroscience*, 2002). It has three parts.

1.  Something is measurably winding up your physical state.
2.  You don't like it.
3.  You don't feel in control.

All three parts are important. If you love riding roller-coasters, for
example, part 2 of the definition isn't fulfilled, and even though
you're physically stimulated and you're not controlling the
roller-coaster, it's not (by this definition) stress.

Funny story, by the way. I was talking about stress to the local Rotary
club, and had accidentally left my notes at home. At one point, having
already told them that there were three parts to the definition of
stress, I realised when I was about to give the third part that I
couldn't remember what it was. I started in on the sentence
anyhow: "And the third part of the definition of stress is..."

Fortunately, by the time I got that far I'd remembered it. (Take a look
above at what the third part is and you'll realise why this gave me a
laugh later on.)

### What You Can Do About Stress

As I hinted, the definition contains important clues to three ways to
reduce stress. There's something we can do about each of the three
parts.

1.  The **physical** approach starts with calming down your body. The
    very simplest way to do this is with breathing. After all, you're
    pretty much guaranteed to be breathing (if you're not, you have
    worse problems than just stress), and while we can't stop breathing
    voluntarily, we can consciously control the depth and rhythm of our
    breath.The old advice to take a few deep breaths in a stressful
    situation works. The reason is that when your body gets into its
    "stress mode", it starts to breathe shallowly and rapidly. You can
    turn that around and feed it back, so that by breathing deeply and
    more slowly, you signal the brain to calm down and switch back into
    "maintenance mode", where it can repair itself, digest food and do
    all those other useful processes.

    (The parts of the brain that control breathing and the parts that
    deal with strong emotion are practically next to each other, along
    with the areas that control heartbeat and blood pressure.)

    Other physical calming techniques include progressive muscle
    relaxation and meditation.

2.  The **emotional** approach addresses the fact that you don't like
    the stress, that you find it unpleasant. There are so many emotional
    techniques that I'm creating a whole course on them (the [Emotional
    Circuit-Breaker Toolkit](http://emotionalcircuitbreaker.com)), but
    here's one simple three-step process that works extremely well. It's
    called the Welcoming Practice.Step 1 is to **become aware of the
    location of the emotion in your body**. Something will have
    tightened, be vibrating, be warm or cool - you'll know it almost as
    soon as you pay attention to it. Just be aware of it for now. Take
    your time.

    Step 2, when you're ready for it, is **to name the emotion and
    accept its presence**. The form of words I use is "Welcome, anger"
    (or fear or sadness or whatever it is - there may be several
    emotions, in which case I welcome each of them by name). Saying the
    name sets up a circuit between the inner "emotion feeling" parts of
    your brain and the outer "word processing" parts in the cerebral
    cortex, and drains off the activation (Liebermann et al.,
    *Psychological Science*, May 2007). "Welcoming" the emotion (not the
    circumstances, by the way, just the emotion) releases your
    resistance to it, which is a big part of what is causing the stress.

    Step 3, again when you're ready, is to **gently let go of the
    emotion and allow it to subside**. In effect, you're telling your
    brain that the emotion isn't needed right now, and so it can go back
    to its normal state.

    I used this to great effect not long ago. I was driving along the
    road and some idiot in a Mini pulled out from a side road,
    completely illegally, right across my path. I braked and swerved and
    just managed to avoid a crash. Now, at one time the fright and anger
    would have stayed with me for an hour, but by using the Welcoming
    Practice, I was fine within a minute or two.

3.  The **cognitive** approach emphasises that, while you can't always
    change the outward situation, you can change the way you think about
    it - and that increases your sense of control.Newman & Stone wrote
    up an interesting experiment in *Annals of Behavioural Medicine*,
    June 1996. They showed two groups of people the same stressful
    silent film, and asked them to make up either a serious narrative
    about it (group 1) or a funny narrative (group 2). They had
    pre-tested their participants for sense of humour, and had
    deliberately put both high-humour and low-humour people in both
    groups.
    What they found was that, regardless of their score on the
    sense-of-humour test, the "funny narrative" group not only said they
    felt better but *were less stressed*, according to standard physical
    tests, than the "serious narrative" group. The film was the same -
    only the story they told themselves about it was different.

So there are three approaches to reducing stress. Whether you coach
yourself to physically relax, shift your emotional state, or change how
you think about the situation, by using these practices you reduce harm
to your body and mind and put yourself more in control.
