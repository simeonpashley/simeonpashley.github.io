There are many ways to communicate with people, what’s your preference?

I have to admit that I find telephone conversations the hardest, they
fall between the disconnection of something like email or status updates
and the ‘proper’ face-to-face meetings we have with people every day.
Telephone conversations also tend to be one-to-one too, conference calls
are a nightmare. There’s no visual clues on when it’s anyone's time to
talk or how people are reacting.

We all know It’s entirely possible to hide behind emails, you can spend
hours crafting every word, editing and re-editing until your happy.

Meeting up with people is always fun, the spontaneity and interaction
obviously surpasses everything else.

I’d rather write a long, carefully crafted email or make a long distance
journey to meet up than make a call.

Everyone’s different, do you have a preference?
