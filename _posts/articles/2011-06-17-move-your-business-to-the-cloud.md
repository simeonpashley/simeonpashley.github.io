 Google Applications represents significant benefits over hosting your
own services and here are a few key
reasons:

<div class="section">

### Proven cost savings

Google's web-based messaging and collaboration apps require no hardware
or software and
 need minimal administration, creating tremendous time and cost savings
for businesses.

End users can use the familiar Microsoft Outlook
 interface for email, contacts and calendar as they transition to Gmail
and Google
 Calendar.

A leading research firm found that Google Apps is as little as 1/3 the
total cost of
 competing solutions.

Microsoft Exchange 2007?

### 50 times more storage than the industry average

Each employee gets 25 GB for email storage, so they can keep important
messages and find
 them instantly with built-in Google search.

Gmail is designed so employees can spend less time managing their
inboxes, and more time
 being productive. Time-saving features like message threading, message
labels, fast
 message search and powerful spam filtering help employees work
efficiently with high
 volumes of email.

### Mobile email, calendar and IM access

With several options for accessing their information while on the go,
employees can be
 productive with Google Apps even when they're not at their desks.

At no extra charge, Google Apps supports over-the-air mobile access on
BlackBerry
 devices, the iPhone, Windows Mobile, Android and many less powerful
phones.

### 99.9% uptime reliability guarantee with synchronous replication

We guarantee that Google Apps will be available at least 99.9% of the
time, so your
 employees are more productive and so you can worry less about system
downtime.**
With synchronous replication, your data and activity in Gmail, Google
Calendar, Google
 Docs and Google Sites is simultaneously preserved in multiple secure
data centers. If one
 data center is unable to serve your requests, the system is designed to
instantly fall
 back to another data center that can serve your account with no
interruption in service.

The Radicati Group found that Microsoft Exchange typically has 60
minutes of unplanned
 downtime per month. Google Apps customers typically experience less
than 15 minutes of
 downtime per month.

### Information security and compliance

When you trust your company's information to Google, you can be
confident that your
 critical information is safe and secure.

Google's information security team, including some of the worldâ€™s
foremost experts
 in information, application and network security, are focused on
keeping your information
 safe. Google and many other customers trust this system with highly
sensitive corporate
 data.
