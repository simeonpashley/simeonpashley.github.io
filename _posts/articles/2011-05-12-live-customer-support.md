-   Want to know who's on your website RIGHT NOW?
-   Want to catch your customers before they abandon their basket?

Chat to your customers live while they're on your website and help them
find what they're looking for with a great online support tool like
[Olark](http://www.olark.com/?r=tcg0p7ld "Olark live chat").

Integration is easy
-------------------

We recently integrated this into our own website and were so impressed
with the results that we began to encourage our existing clients to take
this up.

We simply added the code snippet to our webpage and then connected it to
our desktop client - Pidgin for Windows or Adium for Mac.

Once installed, your website visitors appear as chat clients right
inside your desktop chat client along with basic information about that
particular user.

 On the website, they see that you're 'live' and they can choose to chat
with you if they need help and you can also choose to start chatting to
them.

IMMEDIATE benefits
------------------

Since installing it, we've been able to catch multiple customers before
they walked away and we've genuinely got business we wouldn't have had,
all because of the live customer support that
[Olark](http://www.olark.com/?r=tcg0p7ld "Olark live chat") offers.

Our major eCommerce client installed it too and quickly caught orders
and helped their customers while they were still shopping, those
customers would have walked away without live customer support. [Live
Customer Chat](http://www.olark.com/?r=tcg0p7ld "Olark live chat") paid for itself very quickly.

Olark is our **recommended choice of real-time customer chat** because
it can be extended to capture more business information you can use to
really drill down into those opportunities that may go away without live
customer support.

So far, we've enhanced this
with:

-   **known user names** - find out who's registered and who hasn't
-   **current basket value** - focus on the customers who have a large
    amount of value in their basket
-   **page priority** - catch users who are on your Contact or Checkout
    pages

### Comprehensive Features {style="clear:both;"}

The realtime chat and customer support software is great whether you're
on your own or if you have a team of support people.

The software also generates lots of useful information about your online
chats and visitors, as well as pushing more data out to Google Analytics
so you can really drill down into the detail.
