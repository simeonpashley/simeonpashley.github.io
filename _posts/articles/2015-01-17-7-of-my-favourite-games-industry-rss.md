I spend a lot of my time keeping in touch with what's going off in the
Games Industry and I thought it worthwhile sharingÂ 7 of my favourite
Games Industry [RSS](http://blog.gamefreelancing.com/p/what-is-rss.html) Feeds to keep you all up-to-date.

I personally subscribe to these via [Google
Reader](http://www.google.com/reader), which I find to be an excellent way to keep everything in 1 place and really get the most out of my valuable time. I'd recommend taking this habit up if you haven't
already.

1.  [Develop
    Online](http://www.develop-online.net/ "Develop Magazine Online") -
    This is a little bit of a cheat as Develop splits it's feeds into 3

topics: regular, Blog and Feature so you can choose which is best
    for you. I tend to go for all 3 as it's always a fantastic read and
    much of the content appears way ahead of it's paper variant through
    the post. I like seeing people I know with their names up there and
    also spotting pictures of them too.
2.  [GamesIndustry.Biz](http://www.gamesindustry.biz/ "GI") - This
    **used** to be my most visited UK-centric industry feed and it
    proudly sat at the top of my Google Reader list. It got bumped down
    my list because you now have to register to read full articles,
    which you don't have to on other sites. It's still great, just not
    as convenient as it used to be.
3.  [Gamasutra](http://www.gamasutra.com/ "Gamasutra - The Art & Business of Computer Games") -
    This was ***the <span style="font-weight: normal;"><span
    style="font-style: normal;">game industry web-site a few years ago
    as it was pretty much the only one. In addition to it's US based
    news feed, it's packed full of useful articles, interviews and
    reviews of all things to do with game development.</span></span>***
4.  ***<span style="font-weight: normal;"><span
    style="font-style: normal;">[The iPhone
    Blog](http://www.tipb.com/ "The iPhone Blog") - in their own words
    "The \#1 iPhone, iPad and iPod touch blog!". Strong words but this
    is a useful little site that also sucks in other smartphone info
    too. I believe it's important to always keep your eye on the
    periphery to make sure you don't miss out on
    something.</span></span>***
5.  ***<span style="font-weight: normal;"><span
    style="font-style: normal;">[Escapist
    Magazine](http://www.escapistmagazine.com/ "Kotaku") - pretty much
    the only popular games feed I read as it tends to have the most
    interesting articles, interviews and genuine reviews. I also
    regularly visit many of it's sister sites.</span></span>***
6.  ***<span style="font-weight: normal;"><span
    style="font-style: normal;">[PlayStation.Blog
    (Europe)](http://blog.eu.playstation.com/ "PlayStation.Blog (Europe)") -
    A blog dedicated to all things specific to PlayStation in Europe,
    including specials, interviews, previews and sometimes limited Beta
    codes. Again, used to work for Sony Europe so I like to see the
    products coming through and the people I know doing
    well.</span></span>***
7.  ***<span style="font-weight: normal;"><span
    style="font-style: normal;">[XBox
    Engineering](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/live/engineeringblog/ "PlayStation.Blog (Europe)") -
    This feed a little 'tech thirst' for me and it's a great insight
    into some of the tech that MS publish to show 'under the hood' of
    their SDKs.</span></span>***

What about you? Do you have sites that you visit regularly? Have I
missed a 'must see' site?
