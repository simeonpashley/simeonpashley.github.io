I recently reconnected with an old friend who's been a Freelance Game
Programmer for many years, I asked him what advice he could give to
someone just starting out and here's his top
tips:

I particularly like his ethos: *"value-for-money & minimum hassle", because contractors/freelancers have a general reputation for being otherwise (Expensive & demanding)*

Here's Rhys' reply:

> 2\. Get a good accountant, they are worth their weight in gold, as they

> give could advice as to where to invest your profits.

> 3\. Make yourself as flexible as possible. Making games is still a black

Rhys is a top bloke and I highly recommend him for any programming task
you've got. You'll be amazed at the knowledge Rhys has, how insightful
his views are and just how quickly and well he solves problems. Rhys is
worth his weight in gold.
