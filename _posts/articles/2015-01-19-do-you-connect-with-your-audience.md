The relationship between games and their audience has changed over the
years, thanks to the internet we’re now able to reach out and touch them
directly. This relationship is precious and much more important than
just “cutting out the middleman” to make more money. There’s something
more valuable at stake. Do you know what it is?

### I remember when all this was fields…

I’d like to start with a bit of history that the veterans can skip, it
will hopefully give some background to how this all came about.
Many years ago, the relationship between a developer and their game
ended at the point it left your hands to go to the publisher and
eventually make it’s way to the duplication plant. We were often making
the next game before the last one we’d poured our heart and sole into
hit the shelves. This was a one way trip for your relationship, like
splitting up with a long time partner.
If you worked on a PC then at a push updating, or patching, your game
was only really done to repair some post-release problems. Why was money
on supporting something old when there was something new and entirely
different to make? Beyond PC games, this situation stayed the same for a
long time and only recently changed with the advent of Xbox 360 and
PlayStation 3 where the ability to patch your game enabled retail games
to be updated post-launch. Initially this saw the data and stat updates
in sports titles such as football team data being updated when a new
season started.

### The Game Is Just The Start

Savvy publishers and developers began to connect the idea that your
“retail event” was just the start, it was the key to unlocking your
relationship with their game. Everything you add to your game
strengthens your emotional and cash investment and makes it harder to
part with it. Imagine how much time & effort some of the community level
designers have invested in Little Big Plant, it’s quite astounding and
the other players get a constant stream of new content. It’s entirely
possible you’ll pop it in your PS3 today and never touch the on disk
content.
Titles such as Burnout Paradise led the way in this field by offering
large scale features for free that would previously have warranted a
whole new version and you, the player, spending another load of cash. Of
course if you owned it you were more likely to keep it.
This has the implied effect of reducing trade-ins and secondary sales of
your game.
I’m sure you can think of many other examples of games just like this 
and your audience expects new, updates for the life of the game.
On a smaller scale, iPhone games that sell for £0.59 are constantly
updated with free new content. All of which costs money to make but it
broadens the audience and keeps people coming back for more. I’ve seen
titles release updates that would easily be sold as another game. It can
be hard to understand how developers do this but it’s the result of
maintaining the relationship with your audience. You can plough your
profits back in to make things better.
Maybe music will take this notion up one day, imagine buying an artists 
album and then receiving updates to it for months to come.
Imagine buying a book and the story never ends, chapters get added, the
characters roll on, all for the cost of a single book.
In a digital world, both of these are entirely possible but haven’t
happened, yet.

### Keep your audience close

The iPhone hit the market at the right time and the most critical aspect
was capitalising on iTunes with the App Store. This changed the
traditional relationship between the phone manufacturer and the end
user. The end user now had a direct relationship with the manufacturer
and therefore had a consistent quality experience regardless of the
mobile operator. The iPhone, iTunes and App Store were all Apple
products, not O2, Verizon or Movistar. This was a polar opposite from
the likes of Nokia, who had handed over their brand to the likes of
Orange, O2 and Vodafone who re-branded their phones to mask the
relationship. In this example, Nokia lost touch and they’re clambering
to get it back. You can see echoes of this across various markets,
manufacturers don’t want someone in between you and their brand.
You can do this too, there are many routes straight to your valued
audience and you can maintain that relationship. Think about your own
interpretation of an App Store, think about ways to keep people playing
your game with the promise (and delivery) of more content, connect with
your audience.

### Evolutionary Development

Many games are now adopting a strategy that found it’s early footings in
agile development of web sites, the idea was to launch your site and
iterate your design over time. This is all done live with changes being
rolled out quickly and tested on a small number of connections. Portions
of the site were split throw people in different directions to see how
things worked. “A:B variants” became the norm and now spider out into further variants. When tens of thousands of people hit your site every
hour, you only need to expose your feature to a small percentage to see
if it works and people like it. Amazon, eBay, Facebook, Farmville, Mafia
Wars and many others adopt this strategy on a large scale and it always
results in a better experience for the end user as it’s effectively
designed by them.
Sound familiar? It’s the theory of evolution, the survival of the
fittest where only the successful changes win. In a connect game, make
small changes, test them, gain feedback, kill them, leave them alone or
improve them.

### MVP

Taking this one step further is the strategy of a Minimum Viable Product
(MVP), where you release just enough to make a compelling experience and
then listen to what your audience wants and move on from there. The
trick here is ensuring that this experience is enough to gain that
initial commitment and that the core experience is still amazing. If
it’s not then you’ll find out quickly and you can reverse out and find
something more successful to put your effort into.
Also, every update resets the boredom levels and gives your audience a
good excuse to re-connect with you and talk about your game. Each update
pushes you back to the top of awareness and in some cases gives press
another reason to review your game.
A side effect of this is that all of your brands (game/business/you) get
more hits on the internet and therefore pushes you to the top of search
results that can be critical to your success. A gaming form of Search
Engine Optimisation.

### Your biggest asset is?

In all of these cases your audience is your biggest asset, engage them
early and listen. Also remember that your harshest critic should be your
best friend as they care enough to critique your work and communicate
it, work with them and you’ll get a better game out of it.
If you can, get a community manager or someone experienced in
communicating with an audience of real people, constantly. Once you’ve
worked with a good community manager you can really understand why their
expertise is required and they can make a tangible difference.

### Change the game

Does this sound like an ideal, a garden of Eden, something that’s too
far out of reach? Other games are doing it and it’s expected. If you’re
not going to do it then you’ll lose.

** Change the
game, literally. **
