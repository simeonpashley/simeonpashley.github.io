I've spent a little while this week whiling away the hours with a couple
of music related apps for iPhone / iPad I'd recommend you check-out.
Perfect for a Sunday morning.

### BIT.TRIP BEAT

![](/assets/mzi.egpepgiv.175x175-754.jpg "mzi.egpepgiv.175x175-75")I saw
a video of BIT.TRIP being played over on YouTube and it looked exactly
like my kind of game. It look fun and furious with a great graphic style
all of its own. I had to have it!

Modizer is a great way to check out those old game tracks like Chris
Huelsbeck'sÂ Turrican 2 Intro, and Rob Hubbard's Lightforce and Zoids
played on SID and MOD, not only does it sound amazing but it includes a
nice visualiser too.

It has built in access to HVSC and other libraries of music making it a
breeze to find your favourite tunes and be amazed at what can be
achieved in a tiny bit of memory.

Get your self some old skool tunes!
