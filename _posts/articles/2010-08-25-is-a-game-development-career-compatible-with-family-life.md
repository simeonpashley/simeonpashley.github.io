I've been following the thread over on Luke's blog entitled ['Goodbye,
Realtime
Worlds'](http://lukehalliwell.wordpress.com/2010/08/19/goodbye-realtime-worlds/) and
I've commented in there when the discussion turned to the collateral
effects that being made redundant has in an industry that's so sparsely
spread around the globe. The discussion isn't about overtime in the
short-term, it's more about long-term careers in games when you've got
other people to think about in your life.  Maybe your partner has a
great job, maybe you've got other businesses you're involved with, maybe
you've got children?

It got me wondering what everyone else's experience is like.

**What compromises have you made to balance your career and family?**
