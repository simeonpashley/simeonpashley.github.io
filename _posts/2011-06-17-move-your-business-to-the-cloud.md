Google Applications represents significant benefits over hosting your
own services and here are a few key
reasons:

<div class="section">

### Proven cost savings

Google's web-based messaging and collaboration apps require no hardware
or software and
need minimal administration, creating tremendous time and cost savings
for businesses.

End users can use the familiar Microsoft Outlook
interface for email, contacts and calendar as they transition to Gmail
and Google
Calendar.

A leading research firm found that Google Apps is as little as 1/3 the
total cost of
competing solutions.

Microsoft Exchange 2007?

### 50 times more storage than the industry average

Each employee gets 25 GB for email storage, so they can keep important
messages and find
them instantly with built-in Google search.

Gmail is designed so employees can spend less time managing their
inboxes, and more time
being productive. Time-saving features like message threading, message
labels, fast
message search and powerful spam filtering help employees work
efficiently with high
volumes of email.

### Mobile email, calendar and IM access

With several options for accessing their information while on the go,
employees can be
productive with Google Apps even when they're not at their desks.

At no extra charge, Google Apps supports over-the-air mobile access on
BlackBerry
devices, the iPhone, Windows Mobile, Android and many less powerful
phones.

### 99.9% uptime reliability guarantee with synchronous replication

We guarantee that Google Apps will be available at least 99.9% of the
time, so your
employees are more productive and so you can worry less about system
downtime.\*\*
With synchronous replication, your data and activity in Gmail, Google
Calendar, Google
Docs and Google Sites is simultaneously preserved in multiple secure
data centers. If one
data center is unable to serve your requests, the system is designed to
instantly fall
back to another data center that can serve your account with no
interruption in service.

The Radicati Group found that Microsoft Exchange typically has 60
minutes of unplanned
downtime per month. Google Apps customers typically experience less
than 15 minutes of
downtime per month.

### Information security and compliance

When you trust your company's information to Google, you can be
confident that your
critical information is safe and secure.

Google's information security team, including some of the world's
foremost experts
in information, application and network security, are focused on
keeping your information
safe. Google and many other customers trust this system with highly
sensitive corporate
data.

Businesses get these customizable security features with Google
Apps:

- Custom spam and inbound mail filtering tools, powered by Postini, to
  complement
  powerful spam filters that automatically work with no up-front
  configuration.

  information from being
  distributed, powered by Postini.
- Custom information sharing rules to determine how broadly employees
  are allowed to
  share with Google Docs, Google Calendar and Google Sites.

  to help employees
  pick secure passwords.

  access.

administrators should you need it.
