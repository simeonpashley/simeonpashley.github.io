<p><img alt="Knackered Runner" height="119" src="assets/4633508350_63c6eff451_m.jpg" style="border: 1px #000000 solid; float: left; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-right: 5px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-left: 5px; padding-right: 5px; padding-top: 5px;" width="200" />Every new project starts out exciting and fun. Then it gets harder and less fun, until it hits a low point-really hard, and not much fun at all. And then you find yourself asking if the goal is even worth the hassle.</p>
<p>Are you a finisher?<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>You're probably at Alpha and the hard work really starts now, it's time to stop tinkering, tweaking and adding features and it's time to ship it. Remember, the later in the project you add a feature the more it costs and the riskier it is. Remember that feature that you added in Month 1? It's been well and truly tested against everything else in the game, the new feature you added this morning is just waiting to explode.<br />Post Alpha - resist change. Test it, fix it, balance it, polish it and you're done. Save your ideas for the next one, it'll be bigger and better anyway.</p>
<p>Send me a link to what you're passionate about, your game, business or anything! I'd love to know what you're working on.</p>
