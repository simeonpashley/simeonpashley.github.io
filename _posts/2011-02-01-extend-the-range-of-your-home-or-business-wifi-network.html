<p>I am sometimes asked how to extend the range of your home or business Wifi network using cheap hardware and the ADSL Router your ISP gave you for free and I wanted to share with you my tips.<br />

<p>Extending your home or business Wifi network can be a great solution to connect a remote set of devices like printers, home consoles, desktop computers to a Wifi enabled router that sits in another room.</p>
<p>I have used this solution to extend physical networks into remote offices and also connecting home computers and even XBox 360 to a broader network.</p>
<p>The key to all of this is the amazing <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00019EYVG?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=gamedevelcons-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B00019EYVG">D-Link DWL-2100AP</a>, which you can pickup for about £55 and it's a much cheaper and tidier alternative to running cables around and also using the ethernet over power devices.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00019EYVG?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=gamedevelcons-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B00019EYVG">D-Link DWL-2100AP</a> is a great little device and I'll take you through how I connected a remote home office at the bottom of a garden to the BT Homehub back in the house.</p>
<p>To extend the range of a BT Homehub you need a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>D-Link 2100AP with firmware 2.2eu, the one it usually comes out of a box with.</li>
<li>BT Homehub v1 - the white one.  <strong>NOTE</strong>: This does not work with the black v2 Homehubs as BT disabled the WDS feature that you need</li>
<li>Your network needs to all be running on the same sub-net, the simplest way to do this is to simply change your netmask on everthing to 255.255.0.0.</li>
</ul>
<p>The trick is in configuring the software correctly *AND* not upgrading the firmware beyond the build-in v2.2eu as the newer versions tend to cause more incompatibilities and they don't add or fix any problems you'll have with this configuration. <strong>Stick with firmware v2.2eu.</strong></p>
<h3>1. D-Link 2100AP</h3>
<ul>
<li>Setup your D-Link and connect via the web management interface, usually found at <a href="http://192.168.0.50">http://192.168.0.50</a></li>
<li>Navigate your way through the menus to <strong>Home-&gt;Wireless</strong></li>
<li>Select <strong>Mode: AP Repeater</strong></li>
<li>Under <strong>Site Survey, hit Scan</strong> to find all the devices on your home network.</li>
<li>You should now see your regular home network listed, <strong>select your network</strong> and you will see the information be copied above into the 'Root AP MAC Address' and 'SSID'</li>
<li><strong>Make sure your Authentication details are identical to your Homehub</strong>, if they're not then it simply won't work.</li>
<li>Select '<strong>Apply</strong>' and then you're done here</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-477" title="Dl-WifiRepeater" src="assets/Dl-WifiRepeater.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="508" /></p>
<h3>2. Homehub</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Login to your Homehub</strong>'s web interace, typically at <a href="http://192.168.1.254">http://192.168.1.254</a></li>
<li>Go through the menus: <strong>Advanced -&gt; Configuration -&gt; Wireless -&gt; Repeater</strong></li>
<li><strong>Scan for wireless access points</strong> to discover all of the Accessible Access Points</li>
<li><strong>Tick the box next to your network</strong> in the Accessible Access Points list</li>
<li>Hit <strong>Apply</strong> and thats that.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-478" title="BT-WifiRepeater" src="assets/BT-WifiRepeater.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="279" /></p>
<p>That's it, once your devices have rebooted themselves your 2 networks should be able to see each other. I've done this a few times now and it's worked like a charm every time.</p>
<p>This has failed for me if I've tried to change settings or upgrade firmware (v2.3, v2.4, v2.5) and all have caused me much grief. Stick with firmware v2.2 and it's a breeze.</p>
<h3>Hardware You'll Need</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00019EYVG?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=gamedevelcons-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B00019EYVG">D-Link DWL-2100AP - 108Mbps Super G 802.11G Wireless Access Point</a></li>
<li><strong>OPTIONAL - Netgear GS108 8-port Gigabit Hub</strong><br />
The 2100AP sadly only has 1 network port so you'll need a little network hub if you want to connect more than 1 device to the endpoint.<br />
I've had great success with the small but fast 8-port hub.</li>
<li><strong>Alternative to 2100AP</strong>: <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B000VS08QC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=gamedevelcons-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B000VS08QC">D-Link DAP-1160 Wireless G Open Source Access Point/Router</a></li>
</ul>
