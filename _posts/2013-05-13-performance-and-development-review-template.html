<p>Performance and Development reviews are an important aspect of everyone's career where ever you happen to work. We needed to provide standardised reports that were kept in a staff members file.<br />
<strong>Here's an example:</strong></p>
<hr />
<div>
<table style="border: 1px solid #888;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td colspan="2" valign="top">
<h2 align="center">Performance and Development Review</h2>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td colspan="2" valign="top" width="536">Name of person being reviewed: <b>Dave T. Producer</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Reviewed by: Dave Manager &amp; Sarah Manager</td>
<td>Date: <b>11<sup>th</sup> January 2028</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="border: 1px solid #888;" colspan="2" valign="top">
<h3>Review Notes:</h3>
<p><em>Discuss areas that were of note in the review. <em>Focus on relevant details related to their work</em> </em></p>
<p><em>How has the staff member performed since the last review?</em></p>
<p><em></em><em>Any changes in roles &amp; responsibilities?</em></p>
<p><em>Discuss at length the current roles &amp; responsibilities including </em><em>areas that have &amp; haven't met expectations of both the person being reviewed and what is expected from the role.</em></p>
<p><em>Discuss any boundaries inherent in the role such as managers &amp; sub-ordinates</em></p>
<p><em>Discuss interactions with other members of the business &amp; stakeholders</em></p>
<p><em>How is communication amongst peers, sub-ordinates, managers and all stakeholders?</em></p>
<p><i>Discuss any feedback given from others.</i></p>
<p><em>Discuss performance relative to grade.</em></td>
</tr>
<tr style="border: 1px solid #888;">
<td style="border: 1px solid #888;" colspan="2" valign="top">
<h3><strong>Development and Training</strong></h3>
<p><em>Identify training that has already taken place and any that has been identified as being required. Include gaining experience over time and soft-skills such as communication &amp; visibility, technical skills such as operating software, best practicse in roles &amp; responsibilities.</em></p>
<p><em>Training opportunities may arise within the business.</em></p>
<p><em>Self-training such as reading, researching and discovering opportunities to improve. </em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr style="border: 1px solid #888;">
<td valign="top" width="356">
<h3><b style="line-height: 19px;">SMART Objectives for the next period:</b></h3>
