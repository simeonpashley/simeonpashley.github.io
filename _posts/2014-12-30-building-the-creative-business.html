<p><em>Building the Creative Business</em> is a management course aimed at entrepreneurs operating within the creative industries. I attended at <a href="http://www.london.edu/"><em>London Business School </em></a>where I learned about how to grow a business that is inherently complex and unpredictable due to the creative aspects involved. Ideas often don't work, challenges arise in trying to sell an idea and implementing that idea is often fraught with problems.</p>
<p>Most new ventures fail within the first three years and most failures are related to poor management. The average life span of an entrepreneurial venture in this country is only 24 months. It’s at this point that a poorly conceived business strategy begins to ship water.  <em>Building the Creative Business</em> is an integrative programme that concentrates on the general management challenges facing founders and managers of creative businesses after the start-up.</p>
<p>The course asks the following questions</p>
<ul>
<li>Is my vision realistic?</li>
<li>How am I actually going to do it?</li>
<li>Will it always be this hard?</li>
<li>Where are the great people going to come from to help me make it happen?</li>
<li>How will we recruit, reward, motivate and retain them?</li>
<li>Is our current team up to it? Am I?</li>
<li>How do we finance the business to take the opportunities?</li>
<li>Will the wheels fall off when I don’t control everything myself?</li>
<li>Am I building capital value or have I condemned myself to being a wage slave for life?</li>
</ul>
<h2>My Experience</h2>
<p>There were 9 companies involved in each session, with two delegates attending from each one (the theory being that it needs two people to actually implement the changes, once you return to your business).</p>
<p>The idea is that it helps you to transform your business plan, and then to create an effective five-year growth strategy. It also teaches key business, leadership and financial skills to enable you to implement your new strategy. We discovered that we were still operating as if we were a group of friends rather than a business. Other than a small core team, no one was taking responsibility for anything, and there was a lot of confusion as a result. We started implementing a middle management structure. It will benefit everyone when it is in place, but the challenge is to keep our culture intact. How do you keep the feel of a buzzing game development team as you grow?</p>
<p>The next realisation was that, by creating a middle management structure, those managers could then run teams more effectively, which would free up the art, technical and design director to do more strategic work, and allow us to run a broader 'pyramid' structure, employing more graduates, and increasing our margins.</p>
<h2>Course Content</h2>
<p>The course itself focused on 3 key elements, each of which had it's own dedicated multi-day course</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>People</strong></li>
<li><strong>Strategy</strong></li>
<li><strong>Finance</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>People</h3>
<p>People is about ensuring the business has the right people in the right place with the right training and ensuring that the business has the right structure and culture to accommodate growth and ultimately build value.</p>
<p><strong>Core Concepts</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Our vision</li>
<li>Our resources &amp; capabilities</li>
<li>Our leadership style &amp; culture business</li>
</ul>
<h3>Finance</h3>
<p>Finance is about ensuring that all of the base financial understanding is in place to capture and build profit and value in the business. Every business and it's owners &amp; investors need an exit strategy to maximise the profit for all stakeholders in the business</p>
<p><strong>Core Concepts</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>People &amp; process</li>
<li>Finance &amp; control</li>
<li>Creating &amp; capturing shareholder value</li>
</ul>
<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>Strategy is about choice: the choices that we make about our place in the market-place, and the choices that we make about building the resources that make a great position possible. We explored what factors govern the best choices that you can embed in your business plans, through tools and frameworks that you can apply and insights drawn from a range of sectors.</p>
<p><strong>Core Concepts</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Our markets</li>
<li>Our industry &amp; competitors</li>
<li>Strategy &amp; tactics business</li>
