<p>What motivates you to do what you do? Money, Fame, Knowledge, Entertainment? These are typical motivators for a lot of people and they carry different weights depending on who you are and what state of your life you’re at. Everyone is unique and changes on a regular basis.</p>
<p>As a worker, whilst money is an important practicality of life, the promise of more of it doesn’t motivate everyone to work harder. If you’re employer only offers you cash incentives then it’s very narrow minded and I’d question if they truly understand what motivates people.</p>
<p>I would say that if I wanted money then I’d have left the games industry many years ago and changed careers into something more practical and mundane such as banking (good job I didn’t). I still love what I do and I have no plans to change anytime soon but I am motivated by many things in addition to cold, hard, cash. I am not alone in this.</p>
<p>I have a prime motivator, to stay at the cutting edge of game development. I want to be at the breaking of a wave, riding it forwards not getting swept up by the ensuing tidal wave of change and being dragged under not knowing which way is up.</p>
<p>What motivates you to do what you do?</p>
<p>Challenge? Responsibility? Money? Recognition? One of a myriad of other reasons?</p>
<p>I’d love to know how you feel about this and look forward to reading your comments.</p>
