Over the years I've both pitched many games and been on the receiving
end of pitches too, all of which range from a small game worth £100k up
to AAA hits of close on £10M. I've worked my way through the good & bad
and I wanted to share with you my **complete guide to pitching a game**.

In essence, **Pitching** is about building a bridge between the **Art**
and the **Money,** let's learn how to make that bridge**.**

In order to make this connection we need **3 key elements** to be
successful. These
are:

### A Warning

![image](/assets/img/image3.png "image")

What's presented in this post are general rules that work in most cases
but these aren't definitive rules, you'll need to adapt them to suit
your own needs but the principles are sound and are well-tested.

I also focus on the more traditional slide based presentation that can
be done in the form of a PowerPoint presentation, a series of slides or
even a flip book. These forms work for most projects but the more
creative and unique projects sometimes need something more tangible like
a video or prototype to get a complex idea across.

### Great Idea

Lets drill down into the most important part, the Great Idea that your
presenting. There are 3 main properties your great idea should have…

It needs to be **relevant to a big enough audience** It needs to **stand out from the crowd** And be **Innovative**, in that it offers something new in actual game experience that sets it apart from other games in the genre.

### So how should we structure the pitch?

![image](/assets/img/image7.png "image") A good structure for a pitch is to
cover some basic areas to make sure that all the key information is
shared

- High Concept
- Key Features
- Storyboards
- Business Case
- Pitch Summary
- Defensive Slides

#### How Long Should It Be?

![image](/assets/img/image8.png "image")

It's been scientifically proven that 10 minutes is the greatest amount
of time a person can concentrate before their mind starts to wander.

It may not sound very long but you may well find you struggle to
communicate everything you want in that time and you'll be constantly
trimming your presentation, finely tuning each word and image to make
sure you get the most bang-for-buck.

I would say that you should be able to get across your High Concept in
less than 1 minute, leaving you 9 minutes to get across your features,
scenarios, business case and summary before questions.

### High Concept {style="clear: both;"}

The first element to share is your **High Concept**, what is the game
really all about?

It should be a compelling and unique idea that can be communicated in
just a couple of sentences. This is commonly known as the "Elevator
Pitch" with the idea being that you could jump in a lift on the ground
floor with the person you're presenting to and make your pitch memorable
before they leave on the 2nd floor.

[![image](/assets/img/image_thumb1.png "image")](http://pashley.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/image9.png)

This means that it's important that your **high concept is easy to
communicate**, memorable & easy to pass on.

Once that person gets out of the elevator they're going to tell someone
"Wow! I just heard a great idea in the life, let me tell you about
it..."

Remember this is a hook, it's a seed, it's the first contact with your
idea but it should be finely tuned and water-tight.

Preparing this short High Concept is a tough exercise but it really
focuses your attention and gets to the core of your game idea.

There's an even shorter form of High Concept that's often called the
"**X Statement**", this encapsulates the essence of your idea in just a
few words. They're not intended to tell someone everything about your
idea but just enough to get their appetite going.

Here are a few examples, you could probably guess the game from just the
statement, which is the idea.

<div style="clear: both;">

![image](/assets/img/image10.png "image")

"Improve the Age of your Brain in just 10 minutes a day"

</div>

<div style="clear: both;">

![image](/assets/img/image11.png "image")

"Create virtual people and run their lives"

</div>

#### Set The Scene {style="clear: both;"}

![image](/assets/img/image12.png "image")

So, you've nailed the **High Concept** and now it's time to give some
more detail so everyone understands exactly what our offering is. The
High Concept followed by this extra level of detail will frame the rest
of the presentation.

You're aiming to go top-down, start high and drill in to more detail as
you go deeper into your presentation. This way the concept starts to
become clearer and clearer as you progress.

Adding in layers like this also ensures that everyone is expecting the
same thing, it would be awful if you got 1/2 way through your pitch and
someone said "Ohh, I thought you were pitching a Racing Game but it's
actually a Farming Game"

Cover the
basics: Who is the player in the game? What are they doing in the game? Why are they doing what they're doing? Where is the game set? How do they do it? Who's the audience? What platform is it on?

Remember, keep it high level, add in the layers later in your
presentation.

### Key Features

It's generally held that you only need 4 elements to a product before a
buyer will make their decision. No more, no less.

We have the **High Concept** so we only need **3 Key Features** to get
to a decision point. This means it's incredibly important that these few
things add up to something amazing and it's a lot of pressure to make
sure they're complete and enticing but it's a tried & tested formula.

The **Key Features** need to deliver on the promise set by the High
Concept, they need to expose unique and exciting elements of your game
experience.
Remember:

**<span style="font-size: large;">We only want 3 Key Features</span>**

It's probably true that your game has loads of features but you have to
pick the 3 strongest features on which to hang your pitch.

#### Make It Visual

By far the best way to communicate your **High Concept** and **3 Key
Features** is to use visuals in whatever format you choose.

![image](/assets/img/image49.png "image")

Let's use one of my favourite games, Burnout Paradise (the only PS3
Platinum I have), as an example of how this may work by using some stock
footage from around the 'net. You'd obviously need to use relevant and
specific imagery for your own pitch. These could easily be anything from
pencil sketches, concept drawings, renders or screen captures from a
prototype.

#### High Concept

![image](/assets/img/image14.png "image")
The original Burnout game's X Statement
is:

> "High-Speed, High-Octane, High-Impact Action"

The use of the word "Impact" has 2 meanings here, firstly it means
crashing, secondly it refers to the effect it has on you.

#### Risk = Reward {style="clear: both;"}

![image](/assets/img/image15.png "image")

What takes Burnout beyond a regular car driving game is the element of
"Risk = Reward". The more dangerous you drive, the more risks you take
the greater the reward. This goes around in a loop as the Reward is
boost, which enables you to go faster and take more Risks, which
generates more Boost.

#### Paradise City {style="clear: both;"}

![image](/assets/img/image16.png "image")

"Explore over 250 miles of open road, discovering jumps, stunts and
shortcuts."

This was one of the first games to take place in an expansive open world
called Paradise City. Races and events took place on streets you cruised
around, they crossed over each other and the end of one race became the
start of another - or you could just cruise away.

#### Choose Your Route {style="clear: both;"}

[![burnout-paradise-20080701043017547_640w](/assets/img/burnout-paradise-20080701043017547_640w_thumb.jpg "burnout-paradise-20080701043017547_640w")](http://pashley.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/burnout-paradise-20080701043017547_640w.jpg)

The open world naturally facilitated choosing your own route through the
world, you could take short-cuts, scenic routes and weave your way under
freeways to beat your opponents to the finish line.

These are obviously simple examples taken from stock footage but you can
see how they all fit in with Burnout Paradise's High Concept and they
support each other to make a compelling case. Remember, you don't need
all of your features exposed; just the **Key 3 Features** to sell your
idea. You can leave your various online modes, customisation, range of
vehicles, DLC plans for later.

### Movies {style="clear: both;"}

![image](/assets/img/image17.png "image")

If you have the time then a Movie can be a great way to get across your
point. You may splice bits from other games, TV, Hollywood, DVDs in a
form referred to as a "rip-o-matic" to get the energy, emotion and
essence of your game idea across **but** it's very easy to be
mis-understood and set the wrong expectations using this method. You
don't want to be promising life-like visuals or amazing narrative if
they're not in your plans so be careful.

Stick to communicating your Key Features and the basics
of:

- High Concept
- Core experience
- Character / Objective
- Theme & tone

### Storyboards {style="clear: both;"}

A great way to get across an idea is to take your audience through the
experience in the form of a storyboard, walk-through or scenarios.

![image](/assets/img/image18.png "image")

The aim of your storyboard is the same, its sole aim is to get across
your **High Concept** and **3 Key Features**. Hollywood and TV have used
this model for years and it's also a great tool to use once your game is
in production too to make sure everyone is going in the same direction.

Think of them as a comic that show your features in action as the player
may experience them. This gives them context, meaning and detail that
further cement your idea.

Don't go crazy, stick to 1 or 2 Storyboards and it'll be enough to make
your point and you definitely don't want to bore anyone by saying the
same thing over and over.

Some ideas benefit from more of a narrative context to get the emotion
across and telling a **Story** is the best way to do this. The emotion
makes the feature more memorable too.

> set up to understand stories

> - Roger C Schank, Cognitive Scientist

#### An example Storyboard {style="clear: both;"}

Let's use another of my favourite games as an example of how we can use
a Storyboard to get across our Key Features in a way that is compelling
and memorable.

![image](/assets/img/image21.png "image")

Here's a **Storyboard** that we could use to describe the action of a
Survival Horror featuring Close-Quarter Intense Fights, Interactive
World and Highly Intelligent Opponents in one go. Read through and I'm
sure you'll agree it's a lot more exciting and compelling than a
bullet-point list.

1.  Player is trapped from all sides in a building and must make a stand
2.  The fight begins as the zombies pile in through the broken windows
3.  Running upstairs isn't enough, the zombies pursue from the outside
    and break in on the 1st floor
4.  Player's only hope is to push the ladder away along with all the
    zombies climbing up
5.  The fight is too much so Player escapes through a 1st floor broken
    window
6.  Sadly, Player lands right in front of a tooled-up zombie who
    finishes Player off

### Business Case

Now you've got the game idea across its time to focus on the money;
costs & profit are key areas to cover by discussing the business case
for the project. As a Developer you're aiming to prove that you can make
the game you've promised for a sensible amount of money and what the
up-side is for both parties.

<div style="clear: both;">

![image](/assets/img/image23.png "image")

</div>

As we've seen on Dragon's Den many times there are 2 main aspects to a
deal: the **Emotional** side where the buyer is **figuring out if they like the Idea** (including the Team making it) and the **Practical** business needs. There are many times on DD where the idea is great but the Dragon's just don't like the person pitching the idea.

They'll be asking the following
questions:

- Is there an audience for it?
- Can this team make it? What's the teams heritage? Have they done
  this kind of game before?
- How much do I think it's worth? Is the proposal about right for this
  scope of game?
- Does it meet my business needs?
- Does it fit with portfolio & strategy? Show them that fits within
  their portfolio of games and expands it in new areas
- How much Risk is involved?
- **Can \*we\* make money?**

As a presenter, your role is to make sure that you answer these
questions accurately and with confidence and **make them want to give
you the money!**

**Portfolio fit** – show who this fits in with other games the company
makes by doing your research beforehand.

**Team heritage** – Give a brief overview of the highlights of the teams
pedigree and expose key people to bring kudos

**Headline costs & timeline** – keep the figures high level but don't
forget to include a time-line too, how much and when does the money go
out. Share your expected time-line for delivery of the game to enable
the buyer to think about the earliest point they could sell the game.

**Next Steps** – remind them of the next phase of concepting or
pre-production and what it will bring. After all, the money you need up
to that point is all that you're really looking for a commitment for at
this stage.

### Pitch Summary

_Tell them what you've just told them!_

The sticky bit of business is now down and it's time to re-emphasise
what a great idea it is and remind them that it's something they really
want to be a part of by re-stating your **High Concept** and **3 Key
Features.**

### Defensive Slides {style="clear: both;"}

[![image184_thumb](/assets/img/image184_thumb_thumb.png "image184_thumb")](http://pashley.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/image184_thumb.png)

Now here's a top-secret
tip: Defensive Slides.

These slides hide at the back of your presentation, beyond the "Any
Questions?" slide  and their sole purpose is to be there to support your
answers to any detailed questions that may come up.

Think about what these questions could be during your preparation, maybe
they're slides you culled while you tried to get it down to 10 minutes.

Think about the worst questions you could get, the ones you dread and
get the answer ready and pop in any additional slide you have that
support your answer. It's comforting to know that they're there and
awesome to flick to if the question comes up.

They show you're ready and you're thinking about your proposition from
all angles.

I'd usually include a more detailed financial break-down in here as well
as relevant slides such as detailed milestone schedules, DLC plans,
feature lists, competitive analysis, detailed team bios, references,
alternative date scenarios (bigger team/longer time), etc.

### Summary

Lets cover the main points
again:

Make sure your **Great Idea** is unique and has a big enough audience

Present the idea visually, cut the word count on the slides themselves
to make it more memorable

Focus on the key points, get the hook in to entice the buyer for more
information. Don't overwhelm them.

Provide a complete
solution: Great Idea, Great Team, Great Business Case
