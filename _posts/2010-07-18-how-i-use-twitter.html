<p>(mobile post)<br />
There's an interesting post over on GameProducer.net about how Juuso uses Twitter as part of his game blog that I wanted to emulate here. </p>
<p>I use my @GameLinchpin Twitter feed largely to auto-post new articles from this blog. This is done automatically when I hit publish so it's the best way to keep up-to-date. Simply <a href="http://Twitter.com/gamelinchpin">follow us</a> and you're all set.</p>
<p>I also follow other people in the games industry, not companies, and  join in chats there and also RT (re-tweet) anything I find interesting and relevant to game development. I also follow events such as #e3expo, #develop2010 and #gamescom and RT interesting items too.  </p>
<p>As Juuso says, you really need a client to use Twitter as the basic web service really doesn't scratch the surface of what's possible.<br />
I use Tweetdeck on my iPhone, Home Mac and work PC as it's by far the best app. I use Twitterific on iPad as TD isn't very good yet.</p>
<p>If you're starting out, start by following me then go through my lists and add people from there. Most people will follow you back and it's a good way to kick start your Twitter addiction. </p>
<p>Hashtags are pretty much like public chat channels, you simply follow a hash tag and you join the conversation. This can be an amazing way of getting involved in a community. I've met lots of people on these channels who I continue to chat with on a daily basis. Find a channel, add people for the channel as they're obviously interested and engaged in that subject.   </p>
<p>I follow:<br />
#xblig - Xbox Live Independant Games<br />
#gamedev - general game development<br />
#iPhone - broad iPhone chat<br />
#leanstartup - small business bootstrapping</p>
<p>Event specific ones pop up too such as<br />
#gamescom<br />
#develop2010<br />
#e3expo</p>
<p> Joining Twitter was one of the best things I've done for. Long time and I'd consider it pretty much mandatory for game debs to keep up with a rapidly changing industry. </p>
<p>Which people and #hashtags do you follow?</p>
