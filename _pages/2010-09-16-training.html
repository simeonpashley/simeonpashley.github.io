<p><span style="color: #000066; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica;"> </span><br />
I strongly believe that training and development are the key to ongoing success for both myself and the people I work with.</p>
<p>I actively pursue continuous personal development on an almost daily basis, mostly by learning from others, reading articles on the Internet, in magazines and reading books.</p>
<p>I have also attended the following events as a company representative due to my excellent communication skills, my ability to retain technical knowledge and train other company members.</p>
<div style="margin: 0px;">I continually investigate relevant practises and technologies outside of the obvious games industry elements and incorporate them into my work. These include Marketing, Psychology, PR, Business Development, Software Engineering and Business Management.</p>
</div>
<p>I  also have experience from many smaller courses including internal training courses, Develop Brighton, Game Developer Conferences, IGDA Leadership Forum and gaining the UK government Investors In People accreditation.</p>
