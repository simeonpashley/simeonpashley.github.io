## History

I believe my career is extensive so I have only included recent history. Full details can be found on my [LinkedIn](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/simeonpashley) page.

### Approved Food Ltd. (Jan 2011 - Present)

I initially joined [Approved Food](http://www.approvedfood.co.uk) to make some changes to their aging website. Within a few weeks I was also significantly refactoring and adding features to their internal business management software _My Ticket_ as well, working alongside the business owner. I also adopted management of all their hardware including remote & on-site servers, network infrastructure and client systems.

All software is focused on building scalable intellectual property and is entirely custom written. The focus is on robust, highly optimised software that gets maximum value out of every use.

My role means that I am responsible for internal & external software & hardware on which the whole business depends for it's future.

I also regularly get involved in Marketing and occasionally dabble in artwork for the online platform using Photoshop.

### Career Summary (1986 - Present)

I have been a professional software developer since 1986 with an extensive career in all roles from programmer, through lead & management roles, running a software studio in Sheffield with 40+ employees to becoming Executive Producer for Sony Computer Entertainment Europe, responsible for multi-million pound projects across Europe.

In addition to development my experience includes Project Management (Formal & Agile), People Management (Motivation, Leadership, H.R.,), Marketing, Business Development, Finance Management (Full accounts) and much more.
