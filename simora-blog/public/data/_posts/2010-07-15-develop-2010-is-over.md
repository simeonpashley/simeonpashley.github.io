<span style="font-size: 13.2px;">Well, it looks like Develop 2010 is over for this year (the clue is in the name) and the next event is
[Gamescom](http://www.gamescom.de/en/gamescom/home/index.php) in just over 4 weeks time. Just enough time to detox ready for the next wave of
'networking'. :)</span>

I wonder if Paul the Psychic Octopus predicted the correct Develop Award
winners? It looks like he's patrolling the Gamescom web-site too, so
BEWARE!

<span style="font-size: 13.2px;">Stick with us during the break and
don't go changing channels!</span>
