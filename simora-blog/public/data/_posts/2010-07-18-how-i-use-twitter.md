There's an interesting post over on GameProducer.net about how Juuso
uses Twitter as part of his game blog that I wanted to emulate here.

I use my @simeonpashley Twitter feed largely to auto-post new articles
from this blog. This is done automatically when I hit publish so it's
the best way to keep up-to-date. Simply [follow
us](http://twitter.com/simeonpashley) and you're all set.

I also follow other people in the games industry, not companies, and
join in chats there and also RT (re-tweet) anything I find interesting
and relevant to game development. I also follow events such as \#e3expo,
\#develop2010 and \#gamescom and RT interesting items too.

As Juuso says, you really need a client to use Twitter as the basic web
service really doesn't scratch the surface of what's possible.
I use Tweetdeck on my iPhone, Home Mac and work PC as it's by far the
best app. I use Twitterific on iPad as TD isn't very good yet.

If you're starting out, start by following me then go through my lists
and add people from there. Most people will follow you back and it's a
good way to kick start your Twitter addiction.

Hashtags are pretty much like public chat channels, you simply follow a
hash tag and you join the conversation. This can be an amazing way of
getting involved in a community. I've met lots of people on these
channels who I continue to chat with on a daily basis. Find a channel,
add people for the channel as they're obviously interested and engaged
in that subject.

I follow:
\#xblig - Xbox Live Independant Games
\#gamedev - general game development
\#iPhone - broad iPhone chat
\#leanstartup - small business bootstrapping

Event specific ones pop up too such as
\#gamescom
\#develop2010
\#e3expo

Joining Twitter was one of the best things I've done for. Long time and
I'd consider it pretty much mandatory for game debs to keep up with a
rapidly changing industry.

Which people and \#hashtags do you follow?
