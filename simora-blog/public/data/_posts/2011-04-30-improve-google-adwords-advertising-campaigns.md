Managing an effective **Pay Per Click advertising campaign** on **Google
Adwords** takes experience and skill to do right as there are many
factors that come into play in order to really **maximise your budget
and effectiveness**.

At the time of writing every new Adwords account gets a £30 voucher to
use within 15 days of the account opening so it's worth grabbing that
free cash and using it will.

**Before you go ahead**, setting up a single campaign, with 1 advert
pointing at your homepage driven by lots of keywords is a sure-fire way
to wasting your advertising budget but with a little effort you can make
it work for you.

It's important to understand how your advert will be chosen to be
displayed based on the adverts content, the bid (usually automatically
set) and the page on your website that the advert points to, all of
these components need to work together for the best effect.

## Adwords Quality

A core concept is a number between 1-10 that you will see displayed as
keyword 'quality' within your campaign, the higher the number is the
better the 'quality' of your advert is. The actual mechanics of how this
is calculated is a closely guarded secret by Google but it's definitely
based on the relationship between the keyword, the advert copy and the
content of the web page your linking to.

### Here are some examples to try and give you some ideas.

#### Good - quality is likely to be 8

- keyword: **'ecommerce website'**
- advert: **'Get great ecommerce websites that deliver more
  customers'**
- link to
  page: **http://yourwebsite.com/ecommerce-website** (note the
  keywords are in the linked address)
- page
  content: a page on your website focusing on the keywords
  **'ecommerce website'** - page
  title: **Amazing eCommerce websites** - page
  description: **Amazing ecommerce websites for businesses of
  all sizes.** - page
  keywords: **ecommerce website, website ecommerce, ecommerce
  website**

#### Bad - quality is likely to be 1

- keyword: **'ecommerce website'**
- advert: **'All jobs taken, no job too small. Call us now'.**
- link to
  page: **http://www.yourwebsite.com**
- page
  content: the home page that contains lots of images and contact
  details without the key phrase **'ecommerce website'**

The previous 2 examples of pay-per-click adverts clearly show the
difference between an effective collection of components and ones that
don't work together at all.

Now, here's how advert quality plays how in the advertising campaign.

You can essentially think of 'Quality' as a percentage of how efficient
your pay-per-click bid is for any particular keyword, lets look at an
example. To make this a little simpler we'll imagine fixed bid of £1 for
the adverts above and the formula.

**Bid Value = Quality x Your Bid**

Advert Bid Value your bid

---

Ad A (Good - Quality 8 ) £0.80 8 \* £1
Ad B (Bad - Quality 1) £0.10 1 \* £1

In these examples, Ad A is generating **£0.80 of bid value** compared to
Ad B generating **£0.10 of bid value for every £1 allocated**. If these
2 webpages were competing for the same keywords then **Ad A is very
likely to be seen in prime locations** where **Ad B is never going to be
seen** because £0.10 simply isn't enough to out bid their advertising
competitors to be seen for those keywords.

Sadly, it's all too common to see businesses spending money on online
advertising without realising how ineffective their pay-per-click
adverts are and those **businesses are wasting money** on bad **internet
marketing** and this isn't something you can afford to do.

## Putting together an effective Google Adwords campaign

**Adwords advert quality** is a critical component of an effective
Google Adwords PPC online advertising campaign but it must work in
concert with the page your visitors will land on,
aka: **landing page**. If you're looking to start an Adwords pay-per-click campaign or maximise your internet marketing budget then you need to get a few things right if you're to make best use of your budget.

- Create landing pages for your campaigns on your website
- Choose relevant keywords
- Write advert copy that matches your keywords and landing page
- Check your keyword quality to make sure not wasting cash
- Split your campaign up into multiple keyword:ad:landing page
  segments
- Avoid _negative keywords_ that don't bring you visitors such as
  'jobs', 'career'
- Target specific ad placements such as competitors, forums, special
  groups, to focus on your audience.
  NOTE: this is about where your ad
  is place rather than what keywords you use

You can take this further by adding in some data capturing through
Analytics

- Optimise your landing pages to convert your visitors into customers
- Automatically **track conversions and adjust** your campaign to be
  increasingly efficient

These are some of the elements we carefully setup and manage for any
campaigns we undertake along with a number of **other techniques only
available to our clients**.
