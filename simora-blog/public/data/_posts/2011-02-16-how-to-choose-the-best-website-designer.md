In order to compete in today's tough hospitality economy, business
owners need a strong online presence. The convenience of online
shopping, coupled with the high price of gasoline, means a growing
number of potential customers are on the Internet right now looking for
your business and dreaming of their next vacation destination. So,
whether you are just beginning to sell online or want a more competitive
edge for your existing business, knowing how to choose the best website
designer is a crucial skill.

One word of
caution: when choosing the best designer for your business, never choose based on price alone. While price can be one indicator of whether the designer meets your budget needs, you may unfortunately get what you pay for, which will certainly cost you more in the long run. Hire the best designer you can afford to avoid this common and expensive
mistake.

Of course, paying top dollar does not guarantee you'll get the best
designer either. So let's consider the top 5 qualities to look for in
choosing the best website designer for your
business:

1.  Professionalism
2.  Portfolio
3.  Experience
4.  Creativity
5.  Service

**Professionalism**

Unfortunately, all website designers can create graphic design for your
business website, but not all are professionals. Professionalism seems
to be fading as more and more website designers jump on the freelance
bandwagon to get their share of the buying public's money. Simply
claiming to be the best is not good enough.  Doesn't everyone claim they
provide the best services at the best prices? So pay close attention to
other important signs,
including:

- Is the business web design company interested in specifically what
  elements you'll need on your website for growth, or are you herded
  into their client group and given a select number of templates to
  choose from that look like everyone else's?
- Is the business web designer prepared to take the time to determine
  your target audience?
- Are they interested in your overall business goals?
- Does the designer know enough about your industry, or are they
  willing to learn, in order to trounce the competition?
- IS the design company responsive when you call or send an e-mail? If
  it takes 2 days for them to return your call just to discuss the
  project, what will happen after they've gotten your money?
- Does the designer talk in terms of the future- how they will support
  your needs or continue to work with and maintain your business
  website once is completed?

**Portfolio**

Basically, a picture does speak a thousand words. The best website
designers will have a portfolio of successful sites.  So ask questions.
Seek references. Visit websites they've created. Notice the page ranking
with the search engines.

**Experience**

In essence, the best web designer has the experience necessary to make
the competition pale in comparison. With an in-depth know of SEO (search
engine optimisation) and other marketing strategies, a growing knowledge
base to stay one step ahead, and the focused expertise to increase you
Internet presence, your online visitor will be converted into an online
buyer.

**Creativity**

Templates are a dime a dozen.  Actually, a growing number are freeware.
A novice can take a pre-made web page and, with limited knowledge, build
a website. Thus the end result looks like a thousand other sites
scattered throughout the Internet.  To be number one, you must look like
number one visually, with concise information, consumer-friendly
interactive navigation, stunning pictures and enticing content that
sells.

**Service**

Probably the most import aspect of the best website designer is
service.  A good designer will back up his/her product with ongoing
services to ensure your success.
