...are the opening lines from an this old video game production article
I contributed to a few years for [Develop
Mag](http://www.develop-online.net/) about video game production issues.

_"Mike Cook" is actually Game Production Legend "[Mike
Cox](http://uk.linkedin.com/pub/mike-cox/2/55a/584)" as the author got his name wrong._ :)

Read the full article below, including me waffling on about
multi-platform video game development.

> CHANGING SCOPE
>
> Going back to basics for a moment, development for multiple platforms
> has traditionally always been done because it spreads the cost and
> resulting risk of games development across the biggest audience. With
> games now costing more to create, it would seem that this would be
> needed more now than ever before. Similarly, though, with the large
> disparity between widely popular platforms such as the 360 and Wii,
> going cross-platform means more work, more ideas to exploit
> platform-specific quirks and similarly more money. But is it getting
> to a point where the benefit gained from going cross-platform is
> actually being outweighed by the cost – and is being a multiplatform
> developer really as hard as some say?
>
> At first glance, it is clear that the very definition of
> 'multiplatform' is muddier than it ever was. While it could have
> previously been easily defined as the development of a similar-looking
> title on all of the 'big three's' platforms, Nintendo's decision to
> veer from the road of horsepower advancement and produce a largely
> last-generation specced machine has changed the playing field.
>
> Similarly, with the PlayStation 2 enjoying a long tail in sales that
> none of its contemporaries managed, there's much to be said for
> developing on last-generation machines. And let's not forget the two
> wildly different handhelds while we're at it, and the player interface
> differences that the Wii and DS bring to the table. Suddenly,
> 'multiformat' encompasses a set of vastly different standards of
> dizzying complexity. Or, as Eidos' chief technology officer Julien
> Merceron thinks of it, possibilities.
>
> "Actually, all these platforms are quite exiting to support," he says.
> "You can generalise most games into two cases. The first case is that
> you're making a 'hardcore' game, in which case the chances are you
> might only target PC, Xbox 360 and PS3, and that's not hugely
> difficult.
>
> "The other case is that, if you're making a mainstream game, you'd
> ideally like to support the Wii as well. In that situation, developing
> for the Wii in addition to the other formats isn't the easiest thing
> in the world – especially when each version needs to be cutting edge
> on their respective platform."
>
> One way of reducing the complexity of the latter case, says Merceron,
> is to actually open up to even more platforms. That way, "you could
> potentially develop three sets of
> titles: one for PC/PS3/360, one for
> Wii/PS2/PSP and one for DS and mobile," he says.
>
> CAUGHT IN THE NET
>
> When taking a birds-eye view of the different 'this generation'
> consoles, it's tempting to generalise the differences based solely on
>
> performance: the Wii is weak, the PS3 is strong but the Cell poses
> architectural difficulties, and the Xbox 360 is powerful and less of
> an alien layout. But to do so would miss some of the other large
> issues, especially one such as online gameplay.
>
> **Kuju Sheffield rebranded itself as Chemistry earlier this year, and
> with it decided on Unreal Engine 3 exclusivity. And while that's
> certainly insulated the team from some of the pain of multiplatform
> development – "We've got Epic worrying about the technology, so we can
> be worrying about other things," says managing director Mike Cook – as
> studio manager Simeon Pashley explains, there are still significant
> issues to be worked around.**
>
> **"The very big issue, we feel, is networking. There's no commonality
> on any of the platforms, even to the end-user, on what the experience
> is like," he says. "There are very obvious differences between Xbox
> Live, PlayStation Network and GameSpy or whatever other PC service you
> use."**
>
> As such, part of the network implementation focuses on just getting
> the same core experience right across all of the platforms, and
> working to create uniformity in the face of vastly different attitudes
> in the structures of the various networks. And that's before
> differentiating to take advantage of some of the other functionality
> provided by, say, Xbox Live. It's a another major point that has
> impacted the bottom line for next-gen game production.
>
> Cook is keen to add that it's not just the developers that
> underestimate the cost per platform of implementing network play – the
> publishers are just as guilty of overlooking the complexity involved.
> "It's a massive cost, and it will trip people up," he says. "It's not
> an easy thing to do by any means."

> REAL PROBLEMS
>
> Interestingly, Unreal Engine 3 has in some ways become the poster

> engine and has been epitomised by creator Epic's own Gears of War but

> PS3 showing struggled. At E3, Sony even pledged to work with Epic to
> get the engine working on PS3 with all guns blazing. Six months on,
> and how is the engine faring?
>
> "Epic have done a lot of work on PS3 version of Unreal," explains
> Cook. "The engine was obviously PC and Xbox-lead, by a long way, but I

> of Unreal up to where it should be. It certainly looks the part."

> Naturally, Mark Rein is confident about Unreal Tournament 3's
> PC-equivalent performance on PS3, but admits that it has taken the
> production of one of Epic's own games to get UE3 to ship quality.
> "Like we did last year with Gears of War on the 360, we're kind of

> over it."
>
> Epic's troubles are pertinent because more and more studios are

> development for multiple platforms. The alternative – building
> equal-footed technology for several different architectures and
> performance envelopes – is a job too large for many small- to
> medium-sized developers.
> Merceron points out several reasons for why building a bespoke
> multiplatform engine is more difficult in this generation than it
> might have been in the past.
>
> "These days, experts are rare – losing one key person in your team can

> bigger: even console games are moving
> deeply into the online and social community spaces, an area where
> multiplatform needs to be applicable as well," he adds.
>

> a year having passed since two of the current-gen platforms launched,
> Merceron believes that cross-generation development will be a big
> force in the future.

> "It's correct that there's a lot of bespoke or tailored code,

> structure that's applicable across all of the platforms, so that
> platform-specific features can be abstracted out on top.

> extremely important so that you ensure the implementation will be
> robust and manageable. A poor low level architecture will generate a
> lot of multiplatform issues when designing the high level features."
>
> Part of the problem that developers have had adopting to the high-end
> machines of late has been that of concurrency, the true power only
> obtainable when all of the cores or SPUs are working efficiently. As
> such, splitting big processes into smaller tasks and building a
> super-scheduler to manage them is a major priority for developers

>
> "The SPUs are incredibly hard to program and optimise for," empathises

> to transfer memory yourself – it's a big nightmare."

> programming for the PS3's unbalanced concurrent architecture, but
> developers having to plan how their game will work on anywhere from
> one processor to six. As a reaction, it developed Floodgate, a new but
> integral part of its Gamebryo engine aimed at helping game studios get
> the most performance out of parallel systems. Although it could be
> (somewhat unfairly) described as a scheduler, Floodgate is in
> actuality a system that manages processes running on different cores,
> keeping them thread-safe and their memory managed effectively – and
> scales from the six core PS3 through the Xbox 360 and even the Wii.
>
> "When you've written the task program, you can tell Floodgate to run
> it on one SPU, two SPUs or even all five. It's as simple as that – you
> just say 'run this task on this many SPUs' and it will."
>
> These 'Floodgate programs' can be written in pure C++ to ensure
> cross-platform compatibility and then later rewritten in chip-specific
> assembler during the optimisation stage. The benefit of Floodgate,
> says Carpentier, is that it allows people to get code running on
> multiple processors quickly – and that time saving, which Emergent
> says can amount to around 12 man-months, can be better spent
> optimising, swapping tasks between cores or altering how many cores
> are working on the task.

> that's where you win. Assets that you build are usable on multiple
> platforms. So long as you don't do something like 360 and DS, the

> always been a hard selling point for our technology," he says.

> systems, the 360 and PS3, are very similar in nature to high-end PCs
> in terms of some of the parts that they're using. So it's important to
> remember that we had this problem already on PC in a much larger way
> than we did on the consoles."
>
> And so, as dual- and quad-core chips continue their onslaught into
