Keyword Research<br />
Do your visitors find you by the right keywords? E.g., As a estate agent in Sheffield, you want people to find you by searching for  key words like ‘sheffield estate agent’ not by ‘barnsley caravans‘.<br />
Our keyword research tells you which words are found the most across your whole site and also what the value of these words are. How many people search for ‘birkenhead dog food‘ every month?</p>
<p>You may be completely surprised to find that your site doesn’t really appear for the keywords you think it does. This is where Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) makes a difference.<br />
Website Ranking Check and Keyword Rankings<br />
 This establishes where your website is at the moment; what search engines you appear on, which pages, how many people link back to you, your Google Page Rank, how you rank for the most popular keywords, how many competitors there are etc.<br />
Clean Site<br />
This report will go through the technical and design elements of your website, to highlight coding errors, optimisation issues, graphic/image problems, browser compatibility and user friendliness as well as suggesting any necessary improvements</p>
<p>Developing websites in accordance with the industry standards shortens the development time and makes pages easier to maintain, update & debug.</p>
<p>Search Engines also lower your ranking if your website has missing images or links to deleted content and these can be tough to find, especially when your moving things around or adding new content.</p>
<p>Spelling mistakes also means people won’t find you, e.g., did you type ‘electican‘ where you meant ‘electrician‘.<br />
Website Performance<br />
Making your website pages load fast is not only important for your visitors but it improves your page ranking on search engines. A classic mistake is to overload with lots of badly compressed images, flash and scripts.<br />
