<p>Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) is the process of tweaking various areas of your website to improve it’s importance to search engines in order to appear early and high in Search Engine Result Pages on sites like Google, Yahoo and Bing.</p>
<p>Your competitors are almost certainly using SEO to appear higher in the search results.</p>
<p>Appearing earlier and higher in the search results makes is much more likely that your customers will visitor your site, it’s even harder if your website isn’t even on the 1st page. e.g., which one will your customers click on?</p>
<p>	Competitor A<br />
	Competitor B<br />
	Competitor C<br />
	Competitor D<br />
	Competitor E<br />
	Your Website<br />
	Competitor F</p>
<p>Getting the 1st page won’t happen by itself, your website needs help and that’s where SEO comes in.</p>
<p>The search engines constantly change the rules about how they rank websites and therefore your site could disappear down the ranks if it’s not constantly monitored & up-to-date.</p>
<p>Unlike pay-per-click advertising, clicks on natural listings don’t cost anything so constant SEO is often a better Return On Investment.<br />
Ethical SEO<br />
There are many people out there who will use methods that Google, Yahoo and Bing deem against their terms and they will effectively ban those web-sites from their listings.</p>
<p>We adhere to search engines rules & guidelines to ensure that our customers sites aren’t banned.<br />
Converting Visitors to Customers<br />
We work hard delivering vistors to your site through ethical SEO and it’s important that they have a great experience when they land on your site or they will bounce straight out and over to your competitor.<br />
A great web-site converts your visitors into customers.</p>
<p>Honest advice<br />
It’s true to say, despite our best efforts that it isn’t always achievable and we’ll be honest and give you good advice on just how likely it is that you’ll achieve your goals.</p>
<p>E.g., getting a high rank for the single word ‘iphone‘ is nearly impossible without a great deal of money behind it. However, ‘rotherham plumber‘ is a much more achievable goal.<br />
Our Service<br />
We offer various SEO packages, as listed below, to suit all requirements and budgets.</p>
<p>Some of the Search Engine Optimisation service we offer include:</p>
<p>	Link building – quality links into your website are they key contributor to high page rank and therefore appearing towards the top of the search engine results. Reports state that this alone contributes 33% towards your ability to rank highly.<br />
	“On-page” optimisation – we make sure the search engines can find everything they need and omit everything you don’t want them to find, like your Admin pages. Everything should support your target keywords.<br />
	Visitor-to-Customer optimisation – we take a look at your site from a customers perspective and ensure that the path from visitor to customer is a smooth one<br />
	Full  reporting – detailed performance reporting will accurately track the amount of business your extra clicks have delivered.<br />
	Keyword position reporting – meaningful reports containing information on how your site is performing in the real world, along with data on how your individual keywords are performing.</p>
<p>Real people, hard work<br />
We do the SEO ourselves, we don’t use dodgy tools to generate thousands of useless links or employ an army of cheap labour in Asia to do robotic, bad quality work.</p>
<p>SEO requires an understanding of not only the technical ‘how to’ but also how it relates to your business and what any specific project requires.</p>
<p>How long will it take?</p>
<p>It can take quite a while for your site to move up the ranks to the top of the search results, often it will take 6 months to get there and stay there.</p>
<p>It’s a bit like dieting, you can stop eating for 2 weeks and claim you’ve lost 1 stone or you can manage your diet, exercise and change your lifestyle for life-long results.</p>
<p>Google, Bing and Yahoo are wise to the short-term bulk SEO and if often results in those websites disappearing as fast as they appeared.<br />
How often should SEO be done?<br />
To consistently appear high in the ranks requires constant effort, the search engines change their rules, new competitors appear trying to appear higher than you.</p>
<p>Our recommendation is to get your site fit and healthy in the 1st instance and then to monitor and adapt your website in order to get ever closer to the top of the search engine results pages.</p>
