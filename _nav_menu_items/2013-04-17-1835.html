<p>Search Engine Marketing is a critical aspect of doing business on the web in the 21st century as customers are using search engines such as Google, Yahoo and Bing to find the content and businesses they are looking for.</p>
<p>Using Google as an example, there are 2 ways of getting exposure early and high in the Search Engine Results Pages (SERP) both of which require some effort, SEO and Pay-Per-Click Advertising.<br />
Search Engine Optimisation</p>
