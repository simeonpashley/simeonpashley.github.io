<p>Having your local business on Google Maps (also known as Google Places and Google Local Business) is the best way for your customers to find you.</p>
<p>Google recently stated that 20% of all searches relate to a specific location, for this reason Google now feature local search results above regular results and this is even more critical when considering mobile searches from phones.</p>
<p>Google Places is finely tuned to promote local businesses and bring in new customers and visitors to those who get listed.</p>
<p>Since Google knows where customers are searching from, all they have to do is search for ‘Accountants’ when they’re in Doncaster and it will automatically show them those businesses in the local area, without them typing the location.</p>
<p>Google Places is important for every type of business, even if you don’t have a place for people to come to since many people simply prefer to deal with local people and, as we saw earlier, other businesses will come on Google Maps even if your business doesn’t.</p>
