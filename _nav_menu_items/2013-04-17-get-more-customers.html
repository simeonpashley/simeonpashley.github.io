<p>Our service gives you unlimited direct access to SEO experts, comprehensive website analysis, link building and on-going support at an affordable price<br />
Why is SEO important to small businesses?<br />
85% of online purchases start with a search</p>
<p>Whether you’re a big or small business, if you have a website your online revenues are dependent on traffic volumes. One of the best ways to get traffic is to ensure potential customers find you on search engines for keywords relevant to your business.</p>
<p>SEO stands for Search Engine Optimisation. SEO aims to improve your natural rankings on search engines (as opposed to Pay Per Click) and thus increase your traffic, and ultimately your revenues. The SEO process involves on-site optimisation (website structure, crawlability, content, internal linking…) and off-site optimisation (ethical link building).</p>
