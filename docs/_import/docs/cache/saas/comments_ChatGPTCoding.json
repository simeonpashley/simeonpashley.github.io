Sonnet defaults to it's learned patterns (injecting variables and JS args) , whereas o1 leans towards matching existing code and thinking through the documentation. It's a bit of a special case, I didn't elaborate much. I did previously think it's due to the reasoning step o1 family have, but clearly R1 isn't benefitting from that, but seems to lean even harder into it's own fine-tuning than base instruct models.\n\n\n/u/philip_laureano I'll incorporate that into my instructions and hopefully things will improve a bit in general common tasks, but I feel the issues are more fundamental in my edge cases and it wont change the outcome too much.

This raises a risk for developers in the business or corporate world: any code you input or generate might be used to train the model, potentially exposing sensitive or proprietary information.\n\nAdditionally, unlike tools like Windsurf, which are known for avoiding open-license violations, there\u2019s a chance that Deepseek\u2019s outputs could inadvertently include code that is already licensed to another person or company.

    "body": "Honestly you're best off following some tutorials (and studying security fundamentals) instead of relying on LLMs for this - especially if you're not an experienced dev. Auth is a critical part of an app infrastructure and even a single small mistake or misconfiguration (or hallucination) can result in breaches, hacks, and leaks.\n\nI say this as someone who has built numerous full stack client production apps with AI, and also attempted to use just about every LLM to implement Auth in a new unseen framework (not in training data). I got there in the end, but I had to correct it at multiple stages, I needed a full context aware workflow, I needed exact specifications, I curated relevant documentation, I collaborated with core devs, and in the end I also wrote a significant portion of the code manually.\n\nI wouldn't say the challenge is equal if you're using popular established stack, but unless you know enough to spot and correct the errors, you're taking a massive risk by getting it to code your Auth system.\n\nYou can definitely use it as an aid to teach you best practices, and explain the steps of a tutorial, help debug implementation etc - but I wouldn't in good faith recommend you count on it for implementation, as it is now.",

Then ask the ai to make sure it uses electron (or prompt this at the start) this way you can make it into a program like game and not just a browser game. Like this you can actually add the game to steam etc. \n\n2D games you could totally make very advanced games, and do the same as before with electron.\n\nUsing cursor ai (I think 20$ a month) you could totaly get a fully working game if you keep at it for some time (it won\u2019t be in 1 day, but surely a heck of a lot faster than manually coding). \n\nFree ai options I don\u2019t think so, or are limited very much. For your use case cursor ai will be a gift. \n\nNow for the learning code part, yes learning code will help, is it needed? No, but when the ai makes the code you will probably not understand everything so will be limited to how much you can fix urself, mostly the ai can figure it out when telling it what the problem is.\n\nThough you will never be 100% sure about the codes safety etc because you don\u2019t understand the code. \n\nBut - a lot of people for some reason keep saying, hey u NEED to learn to code before using ai, not true, if you use ai and keep experimenting and asking questions about the code and how it did it, and look and read the code, you WILL learn. Whether you will become an expert coder if you learn this way, I don\u2019t know the answer, -probably not? But you will automatically start to learn how to code if you read the code, ask questions at the same time, and keeping at it . \n\nIf you are willing to learn from other real sources, that\u2019s the better option, but if you are one of the people (and no judgement in this) that doesn\u2019t want to learn to code, but just use ai, go for it - BUT be very careful what kind of code you put our into real world applications that people use. \n\nMaybe then the money you saved from coding with ai instead of urself, could be used to pay some professionals to check the safety of your games.\n\nThough for simple games, which don\u2019t really need personal info etc I don\u2019t think u could make too many safety mistakes, but still could cause problems. \n\nAlso idk how steam exactly works, so it possible you have to integrate account linking etc but Valve will just totally deny you if it\u2019s unsafe or whatever. \n\nTLDR: yes BUT",

You're outsourcing all your developmental needs to AI by likely uploading huge amounts of code at a time which is likely because you wrote basically none of the code in the first place and thus don't understand \\*how\\* your application is working. As Linus Torvalds puts it:\n\n    You copied that function without understanding why it does what it does, and as a result your code IS GARBAGE.\n\n>I also share some of my repos and side projects internally on the dev threads and they seem to get a cold shoulder if I mention any AI.\n\nOf course they will turn a could shoulder, anyone with absolutely no experience in regards to programming can use AI to build an application and people don't want to waste their time reading hundreds of lines of AI code.\n\nIt should be discouraging to not use solely AI and focus on becoming an actual decent developer.

I was genuinely curious and wondering how different people thought about it, including yourself. \n\nI think for some people there seems to only be 2 extremes - You're supposed to use AI for autocomplete only or you are using AI to generate all of your code and you don't understand it. I totally get it too, if you are just feeding prompts, copying and pasting, you are not understanding it. But, what about the in between ground where someone like myself uses it as a learning tool? I love having it directly in my IDE so that I can ask it questions directly related to my project. I am not a developer by trade and don't plan to be one, but I really enjoy learning to code and build things. I can ask it if my functions are properly formatted, or best practices. Things that you probably already know and learned. I am just using various ways of learning those things including AI. \n\n  \nMy point was that as a beginner and someone who is not a developer by trade, I feel that I can read and understand what the AI is putting together and it is faster than writing it from scratch. I should clarify that my projects are almost all for personal learning and fun. I'm not trying build webapps and sell them as professional apps like I wrote them. AI aside, I guess I was curious if other beginners also find themselves being able to read code and understand it, but still sluggish on writing it from scratch, especially larger projects. And if so how do they use AI as a tool, not as an entire app developer. \n\nSo if I could create a small project with AI as an assistant, the code followed best practices, version control, and testing, And I understood how every aspect of the code worked- this would be frowned upon? I see a lot of conflicting views and it's usually developers by trade that have the cold shoulder to others who are using AI as a learning tool/assistant. Our developer use github co-pilot, they use it to create basic functions and help them understand things, I've seen it in the threads. But, everyone has their own opinions.",

I use it daily and spend very little daily. I also balance things out by also relying on other AI models like ChatGPT, Raycast AI, and switching out models for Llama 3.3 and Deep seek V3 for smaller tasks.\n\nAlso, you can get slightly better prices for Claude by using Anthropic's API key.

So a this point, I was the manager, and ChatGPT the developer and sometimes the adviser.\n\n  \nWhen my own code diverged too much with what ChatGPT knew of my code, I started a fresh conversation with the functional code, and would go back on asking to ChatGPT for changes if needed.\n\nNote that I have handwritten tests before writing model logic, so that I'm sure that the code is never broken. \n\nHTML/CSS is still a pain in the ass tho, but finding the design is the hardest part.

IIRC they mentioned or hinted at this in a podcast with Latent Space. If that's the case there isn't an open source alternative because it's not powered by off-the-shelf LLMs. In theory you could run lots of local context into a local model like Qwen and get autocomplete with that kind of contextual awareness, but you would really not be getting fast autocomplete results unless you have a beastly GPU to churn through that context really fast. Autcomplete is basically useless above a certain latency, so there is something of a capability moat that commercial shops with custom models can maintain vs open source offerings.",
