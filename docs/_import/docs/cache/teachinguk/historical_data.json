Now it is 22:00 and the lesson is still not there. I don't know what I'm going to teach tomorrow. I'm worried because I'll get into trouble for not delivering a lesson properly. \n\nMaybe I'm in the wrong (only been teaching for 6 months) because I know we are expected to plan lessons but I only have a vague title with nothing to work with.

However, for my second placement, the university assigned me to a school that is so far away that a daily commute wasn\u2019t an option. The university expected me to relocate near the school, but due to personal circumstances, relocating wasn\u2019t feasible for me.\n\nAs a result, I had to turn down the placement. The university is now saying that finding another placement within a commutable distance isn\u2019t possible, and they\u2019re suggesting I defer my second placement to the next academic year.\n\nI really don\u2019t want to defer, so I\u2019m exploring the option of completing the course this year with just the PGCE component (without QTS). My main concern is whether I\u2019d still be eligible for the bursary if I continue with the coursework and earn my PGCE without QTS.\n\nIf bursary payments would stop, I fear I may have to drop out of the course altogether. This situation has left me in a dark place, and I\u2019m struggling with severe stress and anxiety over what my future holds.\n\nAny advice, insights, or similar experiences would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.",

We\u2019re both pretty new to the class - she\u2019s just been moved from year 5 to year 4 because of behaviour and lower academic ability and I\u2019ve just started at this school. \n\nI\u2019ve been told by other staff who know her longer than me she\u2019s doing much better now but I still feel like I\u2019m not doing enough because there\u2019s still moments she skips class, or walks out in the middle of it, or refuses to look at the board / listen to the teacher talking while she\u2019s sat in class.\n\nThe first week we worked together, we spent more time in the toilet than in class. Thankfully, in the second week, she started to attend classes without me chasing her and usually stays. But there\u2019s still some lessons like today, we were doing RE and PE in the afternoon, and she just walked out of class and refused to do it. It kind of took me by surprise because from morning until lunch she was fine in class but after lunch, she just refused to do anything. We talked about why and she said she just didn\u2019t want to go. I thought maybe it\u2019s a mood thing so we did some colouring, breathing, talking and I tried my best to coax her back into class because I really don\u2019t want her to miss her learning. But she just refused to listen to me.\n\nI feel awful because she\u2019s such a bright girl and on her good days, she does so well, so seeing her miss certain lessons makes me feel so disappointed in myself because I feel like, as her 1:1, I should\u2019ve done something better to get her back into class and engaged but I really don\u2019t know what.\n\nSo yeah I just wanted to ask if anyone else has this type of experience with certain SEMH students who don\u2019t want to do work and if so, how do you combat it because you can\u2019t really drag them back in and do you ever felt incompetent / guilty for not managing to get them to do it? Because I just can\u2019t help feeling so dejected for not doing better \n\nThank you for reading this if you got this far haha :) ",

I started in my class in September as a TA, but I was the defacto teacher (being a qualified teacher) as they had not advertised and filled the position. I applied and got the teaching role, starting officially in the second half of Autumn 2. I've not been able to start ECT induction until now, meaning I will only be able to complete 2/3 of ECT2. \n\nId rather not have to finish off my ECT in a third school, as I may not even secure a position in another school in September and I believe I have enough experience. Also, by that point it will be 5 years since I qualified so I won't be able to short term supply teach if I haven't completed induction. \n\nAs such, I'm hoping that I would be able to reduce my induction, as I will have essentially taught for the whole year, just not officially and not while completing induction.\n\nHow likely is it that this will be possible? \nFor context, I have previously held roles as a Y6 teacher, a HLTA, a TA and as a supply teacher in various settings, including a SEN school. \n\nWould this be possible? Is it worth mentioning to my mentor and SLT? \nThanks \ud83d\ude0a",

I am unsure whether what is happening would be viewed as \"just what happens in some secondary schools this day and age\" etc, or whether it actually is negligence from the school leadership. Furthermore, if I do whistleblow, will anything actually happen?\n\nWhat's prompted me to finally snap and do something is an awful incident last week, one of our lovely Y8 pupils in our school was attacked mid-lesson in a targeted and pre-meditated attack. A Y8 and Y11 pupil rushed into the lesson and beat her up, kicked her in the face multiple times, stamped on her head, harmed her to such an extent she needed to be hospitalised. All over social media rumours. And I know that neither student who did this, despite a history of violence and poor behaviour, will be permanently excluded. Last year one of our pupils did the exact same thing, attacked a pupil from another school on the bus and stamped on her head so hard she had a fit and required a lengthy hospitalisation. No permanent exclusion. Indeed, it seems that children can do anything here, and will still be here the following week.\u00a0\n\nExamples of behaviour that has not warranted a permanent exclusion include:\n\n\\- A gang of pupils beating up a single pupil, filming it and humiliating him by making him kiss their shoes\n\n\\- Pupils being mugged for their possessions\n\n\\- Pupils being caught with knives\n\n\\- Pupils routinely coming into school under the influence of or in possession of drugs\n\n\\- Pupils routinely being sexually harassed or assaulted\n\n\\- Pupils being bullied and harassed online, having their home location and family members doxxed\n\n\\- Pupils calling each other racial slurs and other derogatory terms daily\n\n\\- Pupils are bullied, assaulted multiple times by the same pupil\n\n\\- Pupils have made extreme and graphic rape threats to a female staff member and her daughter who attended the school\n\n\\- Pupils have shown extremely graphic pornography to female pupils without their consent\n\n\\- Pupils have been suspended for 5, 10, 15 times for behaviours that are often violent\n\n\\- Pupils have strangled, punched, kicked and head-butted teachers (sometimes multiple times) \n\nMaybe this is so obviously crazy and criminal that even asking the question raises concerns about my own judgement, and that could very well be true. I feel I have been gaslight by this school so much and I completely numb to what I have to deal with every day. \n\nI have seen so many wonderful children victimised and terrorised with no lasting consequences for the perpetrators. I fear for the long-term effects on their wellbeing and the immediate danger that is posed to them.",

I have no teacher training and just know what I've learned along the way in terms of general behaviour management.\n\nI'll be honest, as a young person and 'just' a cover supervisor I feel a lot closer to the kids than to the teaching staff. I remember very well what it was like to have uptight teachers who put people in detention for silly things. I feel like amongst the kids who can just chill and do the work ie the large majority I am well-liked for having a more relaxed attitude to the more trivial things like tucked in shirts during lessons, chewing gum, having off-topic conversations so long as the work is being done etc. - generally speaking my classroom is a pretty okay place to be if you are willing to make my life easy ie just chill and get the work done. I will generally try to diffuse situations with humour and only give detentions if they're really pushing it.\n\nHowever, despite this some kids just seem to have beef with me and misbehave in a quite pointed way and we can end up in a bit of a power struggle / escalation of behaviours and can be quite rude in the way they speak to me in quite personal terms often in full hearing of the room. I get the feeling they might think I'm gay and this is rooted in homophobia, but that's a separate issue.\n\nAgain, I get that they just don't like me for doing my job ie giving them consequences when they misbehave and disrupt learning and reporting their behaviour to their teachers, and that they are like this with everyone.\n\nObviously, we are not there to be their friends and it's okay if they don't like me. I don't care if a 14 year old boy doesn't like me because I gave him a consequence for throwing his textbook across the room. My point is I still struggle in the midst of the situation sometimes to know what to say / do in response to rudeness and very disruptive behaviours and to de-escalate conflicts / power struggles?\n\nI am conflict-averse as a person, a bit shy and generally quite softly spoken. A student recently in front of the whole class told me to 'go on, speak up' after I'd failed to respond to something else rude he'd said and then sat there laughing with his mates as I continued to freeze up. I just didn't know what to say and didn't really do anything about it and just let it pass. I feel like the class lost a lot of respect for me in that moment.\n\nOn other occasions, I can go the other way and overreact to try and quash a behavior and this just makes it worse and becomes a big scene.\n\nYou have to be so quick on your feet in this job and sometimes I just feel out of my depth. When I reflect on the lesson after the fact, I can always see where things went wrong but it's hard in the moment. Does this just come with experience? Any tips?\n\nEdit: grammar  \n",

There seems to currently be an internal battle within the government.

They also argued that Bridget Phillipson is caving in to the education unions.\n\nLabour MP Siobhain McDonagh has led the Labour backlash to the changes - and is calling for the PM to stick to the current system. \n\nUK\u2019s strictest headteacher, Katharine Birbalsingh says, \u201c'If you take away the freedoms teachers have you're going to have a larger problem when it comes to recruitment'\n\n\nPersonally in my own view, I really do like the bill. Now most academies do pay by the national payscale but it\u2019s good to see the new government ensure some regulations that every teacher will be paid by it. I don\u2019t see it as restricting freedom but basically protecting teachers. What I do find disturbing is how the Tory Party all of a sudden \u201ccares about teachers\u201d when they never had. \n\n\nHowever, I am basically worried because I see critics arguing that this will ensure that there will be a teachers shortage, even though there is one.

While I've worked with children with a wide variety of needs before, it feels like those needs are becoming increasingly complex.\n\nI'm currently teaching a Year 1 class where not a single child is working at age-related expectations. There are two children with EHCPs (one still in pull-ups), but realistically, there are four children who need EHCPs. My year group partner and I share one TA, who is constantly running between our classrooms managing behaviour, changing nappies, or assisting other rooms.\n\nThe headteacher insists this is the situation in all schools, and from my experience, I don\u2019t disagree. However, it seems like every year, there are more children with high needs and less support to manage them.\n\nIs anyone else experiencing this? Or am I just working in the wrong schools? For context, the staff are lovely, the planning is manageable, and the marking policy is straightforward\u2014but the children are off the walls! I honestly think I need a change of career. ",

I know technically I\u2019ve done nothing wrong here, but I am struggling to \u201cleave it at work\u201d and it\u2019s affecting my weekend. I am new to the school since September in a middle-leader position and still establishing myself, but I\u2019ve been teaching for 12 years and proactively anti-racist (or so I thought) so I know better than to let things like this slide. But, the member of SLT is my superior, and I kind of froze as I was caught off guard. Mainly I\u2019m worried this will damage the relationship I\u2019ve built with my tutor group, as well as worrying about how this will affect the way SLT will see me for not shutting it down or reporting it. My thoughts are that I pull the student aside on Monday and apologise for letting it slide. Wondering what you all would do!",

It helps to spread out the lunch rush and gives flexibility to people who want to eat earlier and shift around their working times. \n\nSince the start of the new term, my primary school outreach has been paused. Instead I have been asked to supervise U6 students from 13:00-15:00. This involves walking them from the girls\u2019 school to the boys\u2019 school (on the same site, shared facilities) and sitting in a room while another member of staff delivers an activity. The number of students in the room would be well below any staff:student ratio requiring additional staff. \n\nThis leaves me with a 5 minute break between P5 and this responsibility commencing. When I highlighted this to the headteacher, they saw no issue as I could use P5 to eat lunch and go to the toilet. \n\nIn my mind, it is unreasonable to take away my lunch break and remove the element of choice in using my \u201cfree/PPA\u201d period for work or to eat. Even more so because I am so late in my pregnancy at a time where it would be reasonable for me to request additional rather than fewer break times.\n\nCould anyone offer some perspective or advice on this issue. It\u2019s hard to look objectively at it because it feels very emotive as a very tired, fed up and uncomfortable late stage pregnant person! ",

The kids here are wonderfully behaved and the best I've ever taught. 95% of my time I spend teaching and 5% behavior management. But it is this absolute bellend of a HOD who is so disorganized and throws everything together at the last minute or changes things at the last minute and will decide whether he takes the class you share with him or not at the last moment. \n\nThere are no resources for me to adapt my lesson round (I actually don't mind planning my own lessons, what I don't like is the passive aggressive sneering that I'm a thicko because I can't second guess what this idiot wants covered because he doesn't communicate. \n\nI was on a steady trajectory upwards at my first placement. I was doing quite well with some massive errors made that made for some awkward conversations (I was so focused on my subject pedagogy, knowledge, actually planning, managing a classroom and pastoral duties as a form tutor that I overlooked marking for year 10 because I wasn't clear on how to do it). But it was good and I really felt like I had found a good school and with the kids knowing me, I felt secure. \n\nNow I've gone from someone hyper-organised who sets the lead and I follow my initiative and rightly get pulled up (like with the marking) if I make errors, to a Mr Bean type figure who stands in my classroom trying to intimidate me and then tears me down. \n\nIf this is what teaching is like in the UK, I'm out of it. And I say that as someone who never feels happier then when I'm in front of the classroom teaching and what I cling to is a note I was given by a Headteacher 18 months ago when I was doing unqualified supply, saying 'you've made such a positive difference in such a short space of time, you have the potential to be a brilliant teacher and we will always welcome you back'.

My course was going really well during my first placement, I felt like a part of my first school, had a great relationship with my mentor and really felt very confident. I was always praised for my classroom management and subject knowledge, and I had a moderation QA visitor who told me I was one of the strongest trainees he's ever seen.\n\nComing into my second placement, my confidence has taken a huge hit. My current placement school is very different, there is no consistency between teachers, a huge amount of permanent cover supply teachers and I barely see my mentor. Teaching lessons is hard as the behaviour system and policy here is very weak and sanctions don't seem to have any effect on students. I spend about 80% of my lessons trying to get students to stop talking over me. My mentor is never around, the teachers I share classes with are either totally hands off or step in instantly to issue sanctions without giving me a chance to react. \n\nIt has only been two weeks but I get very negative lesson feedback and feel like I haven't even had a chance to actually teach. I feel like there's no point in planning anything as it gets derailed instantly. I have discussed the issues with my training provider who gave my mentor some more training (seemingly has had no impact), and I was offered to transfer to another school but all the options are 1 hour+ commute.\n\nWhat I have tried so far:\n-Using attention grabbers (like counting down from 5, saying that I'm still waiting for X amount of pupils)\n-Praising positive behaviour \n-Issuing sanctions accordingly and escalating them as needed\n-Pausing and not continuing until I have silence \n\nNext few lessons I'm going to do a reminder of expectations and modelling what I'm looking for, as well as issuing more positive behaviour points. I know it hasn't been long being here and the students don't know me yet but I just feel really deflated and am second-guessing myself. \n\nAdditionally, my training provider is doing a lot of study sessions about jobs and applications and jobs fairs etc. This is just adding to my stress because I feel my confidence is shattered and if I did get any interviews, they'd be a mess. I'm also not even halfway through the course so it feels crazy early to me to even be thinking about jobs? Personally I want to wait a few more months to also help decide where I actually want to work and what I'm looking for, but the training provider is making me feel like I'm making a huge mistake if I don't apply now. \n\nOverall, just feeling very overwhelmed.

      "selftext": "So, this January I made the insane decision to move schools mid year, and spent a chunk of my Xmas break in my new classroom setting up and clearing out old junk.\n\nIn the process, I did many of the usual things I do when setting up a class, putting up displays, organising draws etcetera, etcetera, and one of the things I have always done is put up old class photos of me with my previous classes. For the past 6 years that hasn't been an issue, but on the first day back last week, my TA pointed out that she was worried it may be a safeguarding concern, or a GDPR breach, to have those pics up on the wall, without having received the consent from the parents of the kids.\n\nFor context, the pictures have no school name anywhere on them, just a year and class name (non-descript British tree name), uniforms are all logo free, and there would be no way for anyone to identify anyone in the picture beyond \"Mr CookieGuvna taught this kid in 2022.\"\n\nAnyone got any advice on whether she has a point? I have always done it, as I am a Year 6 teacher, and have always told the kids in my class that they are \"my kids\" even after they leave, and that I continue to care about them once they leave. I don't need OFSTED coming in and going \"oy, mate, this is a problem!\"\n\nTL:DR - TA thinks my old class photos are a GDPR problem. Is she right?",

They've come back and now my most tricky child is acting up in a way he never has before; he would generally try to push boundaries before but would listen when given conditions. The last 2 weeks I've seen behaviour from him that I haven't in almost 2 months. I've also got others constantly bubbling, fidgeting constantly on the carpet and a couple of low level strops. I had another boy shake his head and refuse to line up today before I gave him 'the look'. I had to seriously tell the class off yesterday which I haven't had to in a while. Do I treat it like September and go back to basics again? I'm just so disappointed in them because I really thought we'd gotten to this great place as a class where there was a genuine love for the learning and respect.

      "selftext": "tldr: What are we extrinsically motivated to do? If I teach great lessons but let a few admin tasks slide, I get grief from management and nothing positive about the quality of my lessons. If I teach average to poor lessons but complete all admin tasks, I hear nothing at all. What does management truly want from us? Any advice?\n\nI've been teaching maths for 9 years. I've taught the same topics many, many times. Still, I genuinely take great interest in constantly tweaking lesson plans to reflect when I last taught it (questions that were asked, unexpected misconceptions that arose, pacing issues depending on set, etc.). I also enjoy carefully selecting topics for my KS4 lesson starters that reflect gaps in learning identified in our fortnightly test and working on those gaps across the week. The majority of my \"spare\" time at school is spent doing this. Partly because I consciously believe it's my job, but mostly because I genuinely enjoy the process of producing a good sequence of examples and considering interesting questions to pose.\n\nThe effect in class seems to be positive. Anecdotally, I see the benefits on my pupils: engagement is generally good, I foster good relationships and they seem to make good progress. To me, that means I'm doing my job well. Not that I necessarily need it, but I very rarely see recognition or any sort of encouragement of this behaviour.\n\nThe only \"feedback\" I tend to receive is a notification of something I haven't done. This generally includes simple admin tasks like not setting enough house points, marking homework a day late or not recording some data in the latest \"correct\" form.\n\nMy point isn't that I shouldn't be picked up on these things. I probably should. And I should probably just stay up to date. But it makes me question what I'm truly being motivated to do. Hypothetically, it seems that I sit somewhere between two extremes: \n\n1) Teaching 25 engaging lessons throughout the week, miss a few admin tasks and hearing about it, and\n\n2) Teaching 25 average to poor lessons throughout the week, miss zero admin bits and hearing nothing at all\n\nWe all know teaching can be very full on. It seems to me that teaching to the near best of my ability, completing all admin tasks and having a decent work-life balance seems impossible. Something has to give, and I can't let it be work-life balance. So it's either I prioritise teaching high quality lessons (perhaps by my own standard) and let a few admin things slide, or I minimise \"management grief\" by ensuring all admin tasks get done to the detriment of my lessons. If I am full of resolve, I consciously choose the former. If I'm tired and I want the path of least resistance, I allow the latter. Which feels wrong and does get to me. And the point I'm trying to make, I think, is that based solely on management behaviour and what they pick up on it feels like the latter is what they prefer, also.\n\nI'm hoping someone on here can tell me what I'm missing or has any advice because I'm tired of being torn between doing what I think is right by the kids, and what gives me the least grief from my ever-growing list of \"line managers\".",

I\u2019ve never been in with the cliques and crowds, always keeping my head down and getting the job done. \n\nI have some firm work/life balance boundaries as I\u2019m a single parent and value my evenings and weekends so I prefer not to engage in too much staff room gossip and I sit quietly in my PPA time and get work done. \n\nBefore and after school I like to use my time wisely, get my printing done and then set up my classroom. It takes a while as I have a practical subject. I feel like I\u2019m paying to put my own kid in to wraparound care so I\u2019m going to use that time productively. \n\nI always greet people politely and will have a little bit of small talk but I can\u2019t spend any meaningful time with any colleagues, especially outside of work as I\u2019m a single parent. I can never go to after work drinks or the staff Xmas party as I don\u2019t have childcare, and also can\u2019t justify spending my money on a babysitter, taxis, new outfits etc just for one night. \n\nI might agree with some of my colleagues about meetings and training and admin tasks being a bit ridiculous but I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth wasting time moaning about it because deadlines will never get changed in that manner. I personally speak to my line manager about things I am worried about and ask which tasks I should prioritise  and as such have had deadlines extended for me or had tasks be reduced - for example I was allowed to conduct some internal key stage 3 assessments outside of the planned week because I also had year eleven coursework to mark for external deadlines. That was in my mind justified but clearly this doesn\u2019t help matters as colleagues make passive aggressive comments that I tend to have more flexibility, and have different rules.  \n\nAt lunch time I used to also try to get some stuff done and would sit in my classroom reviewing pupil books but I realised that I do need a break myself so I\u2019ve started sitting in the staff room for half an hour with my food. \n\nEvery time I walk in the room goes quiet, and there\u2019s several different tables with groups of 3/4 people but plenty of space - it\u2019s like a scene from a teen movie where no one seems to want to make room for me. I\u2019m not the only one, a few other people seem to look and feel awkward so I\u2019ve managed to chat to them, however there\u2019s one clique which has about seven people who are always present and just not very nice. \n\nI have tried to shake it off, just be polite and greet anyone and everyone cheerily but I\u2019ve always felt a bit tense. \n\nI think I\u2019ve seen them text each other across the table when I have been sat there, make strange faces and also make some quite frosty comments. \n\nToday I actually saw one of the cliquey group roll their eyes at me when they didn\u2019t realise I could see them and I just felt horrible. \n\nI\u2019ve got a lot going on, feel quite lonely and isolated  and I don\u2019t want to come to work and feel like I\u2019m the odd one out. I\u2019m also far too old for this nonsense. It\u2019s worse behaviour than the children. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what to do about it, or if there is anything I can do except play like I\u2019m oblivious to it, stay professional and polite and pretend like I don\u2019t notice and/or care. \n\nWhat I\u2019d really like to do is ask if anyone has a problem with me but I know it won\u2019t achieve anything. \n\nI just genuinely don\u2019t know what I\u2019ve done wrong, I don\u2019t want to be in a clique but I don\u2019t want to feel uncomfortable in a staff room on my break every lunch time ",

I tried. last term. going over every lesson I teach and updating it and making it something that actually bloody has some serious content and you can feel a bit like the expert in the room and. A lot of the time, delivering the standard stuff you have leads to low level disruption, lack of engagement and generally no sense of satsifaction for either the pupils or the teacher. One thing is certainly true, it;s bloody hard work because it makes the teacher have to work twice as hard to fill in the gaps. But here's the thing, planning and adapting everything nearly destroyed me. I was working ridiculous hours and realised that the only way I could ever be in a position where by I had lessons for all my topics to the standard that would just fill an hour with something concrete and meaningful and stretching, would require me to take two to three months off work just so I could plan and prep it all before I eventually delivered it. I certainly can't sustain both. Never have been able to. \n\nThis is not a new problem for me and I've taught at a number of schools over the years and it's been an issue in more than one. I find that if I sit down and plan a lesson it takes me a good hour and half at least to make it in a way in which I'd look forward and feel a bit more confident, teaching it, but I couldn't sustain that for every lesson I've got to teach and no one else can either. \n\nHonestly, I've never found a solve for this in two decades of teaching.  When it comes to A level where I did break my neck planning all my own resources early on, then that's my favourite stuff to teach. I like what I'm teaching, I planned it from scratch, and it's where I feel most fulfilled. At KS3 and 4, that has never been the case. Ever in over two decades. ",

One problem I have is we only have like 15-20 minutes of time as breaks are only 25 minutes. One activity I usually do around Easter is we decorate ginger bread people and talk about how we decorate them can't certainly tell us anything about their identity and this applies to people as well. Sometimes we'll watch a video about stonewall or something but it's hard to find something appropriate for year 7 to sixth form.

Like, to the extent that I'm beginning to wonder if I'm just old fashioned (or crazy) for expecting them to do stuff like raise their hands instead of calling out, or do silent work. \n\nHonestly I'd love it if they could do work whilst quietly chatting to a neighbour, but they *can't*. Their two volumes are 'mute' (hard to achieve, won't last more than two minutes even if I'm actively talking) OR playground/dining hall level.\n\nI'm taking a harder line this term behaviour-wise, but I feel so mean doing it. Getting them quiet means constantly being in a state of reprimanding them, or handing out sanctions, or stopping everything to restate expectations.\n\nI feel like the villain in a kids' TV show.\n\nAnd what's worse is, there are about five kids in each class who are genuinely interested in the subject *and* capable of behaving. If the whole class was like them, then we could do all sorts of fun projects and group activities and such.\n\nBut instead, they have to deal with frequent whole class 'come to Jesus' talks about expectations, zero tolerance policies and less fun activities.\n\nI know that long-term, being in a classroom that isn't total chaos will probably be better for those kids, but how do you handle that transition without feeling like the kind of 'mean teacher' that we all hated in school?",

I am a quite anxious person, so I decided to come here and ask, but it's starting to feel like a bad idea. Perhaps I thought I'd get more guidance, given that I don't have any experience and to be honest I have no idea what's going on. \n\nI'm considering calling them on Monday to ask some questions, but I'm really not sure what to ask anymore, as when I asked about bookings/timing etc my agent said they will contact me and it can be anytime from a week/couple of days/a day/couple hours before the job, she said it's \"fast paced\".\n\nPerhaps they asked me to update my calendar so they can see when I'm available to do trial shifts.

She got pissed of when I came back late and was like \u2018look at them they\u2019ve done nothing\u2019. She doesn\u2019t control my breaks but she keeps telling me when to take them and to come back early to hand out books and sheets. I hate her I hate everything. I love the class and they love me but I just want to leave now I feel so insecure it\u2019s ruined my confident",

      "selftext": "I have been an RS specialist for 20 years and I can remember writing an essay during PGCE questioning where the relevance lay in the subject I was training to teach at the time? \n\nI remember back then, the \u2018fashion\u2019 was to use religions to teach about broader themes so as make the subject more inclusive. That came at the cost of more academic rigour on the subject which has been a bit iffy really when I consider teaching over two decades. \n\nEven back then, the types of people choosing to teach RS - me included - were not particularly very knowledgeable about theology or religions and many of us came to the subject having got degrees in other things entirely. \n\nAs an RS teacher, most today (again, including myself) aren\u2019t particularly super specialists in religions per se - we know a bit about our subjects based mainly on course content we\u2019ve had to learn but beyond that, you might struggle to find many RS teachers who are particularly scholarly or specialised in their knowledge of religion. Which is okay but we\u2019re a curious bunch when you compare that to other subjects where more practitioners tend to really love their subject as an academic discipline and their knowledge of the subject is probably a lot deeper than the average GCSE RS teacher is of any religion you might care to discuss. \n\nThat\u2019s also notable because for some of us, we can remember old school RS teachers from back in the day - many of them I was taught by or were near retirement when I started, really knew about religions and their subject and you just don\u2019t get that now. \n\nOn top of this, it\u2019s hard to see how much longer we can keep maintaining a justification for our subject when the population has rapidly secularised and most classes now consist of a majority of non-religious students or students from religious backgrounds whose knowledge of their religion is often far in excess of the teachers and the lesson content! It\u2019s their lived faith after all. It\u2019s certainly great for some Muslim kids for example, who might not be doing so well in school but find they\u2019re actually at an advantage over almost everyone else in the class but a lot of the time the content can hardly be said to stretch them. \n\nOf course, the subject content has some importance for wider social inclusion and that\u2019s valuable up to a point but that function is usually exhausted by KS4 and if they\u2019re not willing to continue studies into GCSE, it\u2019s often hard to justify - and increasingly difficult - to force kids who don\u2019t want to learn about the subject to care. \n\nThen there\u2019s the subject\u2019s overall status and how it is perceived in non faith schools and among colleagues. Most teachers are kind, respectful and assume that RS is important in some hard to comfortably define way and of course, it\u2019s good that someone is teaching it because it\u2019s a legal requirement. But here\u2019s the thing, for many, they\u2019re glad it\u2019s not them and they secretly don\u2019t really see how the subject has any serious relevance or importance compared to other subjects - and I get that! \n\nMy point is, I think RS teachers have to tell themselves their subject is important because it\u2019s what we teach but I do wonder how many of us secretly think \u2018we\u2019re lucky to have a job but I\u2019m not sure if we\u2019re THAT important\u2019. \n\nA fact that is pressing when you consider how many schools were quick to save money by getting rid of their specialists. It\u2019s hard to see a government ever doing that with another subject. \n\nI am just interested in this. How many RS teachers aren\u2019t really convinced that their subject is that relevant anymore or think it will probably disappear in the future or be even more greatly reduced? ",

Consistently, staff vote overwhelmingly *yes*. I'm the exact opposite and a lone 'no' vote. \n\nAn INSET day usually isn't 6 hours of full-on coverage, it's usually quite chilled and I'm more in the mood to take on board initiatives at 10am on a child-free day than I am at 5:45pm on a Monday. There's also often some prep time in classrooms and quite a chill lunch. Swapping that for extra-long evening work for an entire half-term to make up the 6 hours seems like a bad swap. Evening CPD is bad enough at the best of times.\n\nBut staff at my school would treat me as insane. They jump at the extra day off, even when I'm convinced SLT only offer it when they planned the INSET day session in time. What are your thoughts?",

Its amazing how some SLT are able to make you feel like just another child they're dealing with, I will contact my union if needs be.\n\n Hi everyone. I'd usually post on a Facebook group I'm in but I have coworkers on there who I'd prefer didn't read this. \n\nOver Christmas my daughter (12) fainted aeound a month ago, originally i wasnt hugely concerned and ordered vitamins and made diet changes, upping iron etc. However this happened again over christmas and she is going lightheaded whenever she moves too fast. There is family history of thyroid problems and anemia on my side and her Dad's family history is unknown so I got her in with the doctors realising it needed more attention and at the appointment was today they've asked me to book an ECG and a blood test, seeing as she first fainted back in November I took the soonest appointment as her health comes first, it's next Thursday at 11.\n\nI've been with my current school 3 years now as a TA and I'm just wondering how to handle this with my headteacher? I already know the answer would probably be no, or can anyone else take her, I don't have access to policies to properly comb through right now but when I asked to leave early for an orthodontist appointment for her I was told it didn't qualify. That was easily rebooked but this is more important imo. Part of me is thinking of just ringing in and explaining she's unwell rather than trying to beg for them to let me take her.\n\nCan I ask for advice, or what others have done I'm similar situations?",

Unfortunately in the meeting nothing shifted and I was essentially given a \"this is how we do it in this department\" so it has continued. I understand the importance for long term planning but this is breakdowns of each activity that I will do in each lesson for the entire half term which feels like overkill. \n\nHe also reviews my resources weekly for the next week, on top of the other problem this makes me feel quite untrusted to do my job and be a professional.\n\nI have recieved praise for all of my lesson observations so far and I am confident that I am a good teacher so I am unsure why I am not being trusted. \n\nFinishing off my rant I feel quite sidelined and uncomfortable in department, I naturally am quite optimistic and want to help even when I am not sure how so I have been the butt of jokes mostly from my HOD implying that I am airheaded - in my probation meeting he compared me to his dog because I am \"not always sure whats going on but I'm happy to be there\". The comments are made as jokes but it's really shaken my confidence.\n\nThe good news is I passed probation and I know my teaching itself is going well. \n\nI am only here until the end of the academic year but I am really dreading going back next week, I live on site away from friends or family and its quite isolating with the only adults I speak to being my colleagues.

      "title": "Reaching out: Hope and Despair in education and the New Year.",
      "selftext": "Hello all.\n\nI hope everyone's Xmas break has been restful and Happy New Year..\n\nThis previous term has been the most difficult of my career.  In short I've been struggling.  I'm sharing part of my story here in the hope that anyone else going through something similar may feel less alone or might find something useful in it.\n\nFor the last 5 years of my professional life I have been working in various schools at varying levels.  I love working in schools.  I love teaching children, I love helping to run a school.  I love the theory and practice of education, bottom sets, top sets, SEN, EAL, Gifted and Talented, cover, whatever, I love it.  Teaching, and the jobs that making teaching happen, give me energy, and purpose and meaning in a way that my previous, much higher paying roles, simply did and could not.  I'll say it again: I love being a teacher.  \n\nMy career into teaching has been somewhat circuitous, I began working in inner city schools with higher levels of deprivation, EAL, SEN as a HLTA and then moved to be cover supervisor then cover manger then trainee teacher.  Even when I didn't really know what I was doing, I thrived, I took every opportunity I could with some of the worst behaved classes. I learnt, with the guidance of many supportive teachers, how to manage behaviour, how to build relationships and how to teach.  Even before my ITT year I was getting feedback and results that demonstrated I had a lot of actualised potential.  This was fantastic news to me because this meant I could be successful in what felt like the only career I could ever really happily do.  \n\nThe conditions of my informal and formal years learning how to teach were objectively more difficult than the average school.  The location and cohort were notorious in the city, we had massive rate of PP, SEN and EAL.  As a consequence, I must confess, when I saw ITTs, PGCEs and ECTs describing their tough experiences on this forum I assumed they just weren't cut out to teach.  I erroneously and arrogantly blamed the teacher posting.  I mean teaching isn't for everyone, if I can do what I was doing without formal training in the schools I was doing it with all my extra admin responsibilities, then surely it was the fault of the trainee teacher for struggling.  \n\nI no longer think this way.  After finishing my PGCE and ITT, for personal reasons, I moved area and thus moved school.  My new school came with none of the social problems my previous schools did, much more affluence, and much higher average grades.  I assumed it would be a cake walk.  I was very wrong.  My experience of management has been the 100% opposite of the the other 4 schools I have worked at.  I won't go into all the details about myself and my new school's management style but suffice it to say that my face doesn't fit there.  The energy and purpose that used to flow from my work life has been transformed into a low level anxiety damned up by random, and inconsistent in its nature, negative feedback. Now I haven't changed my levels of effort or approach to teaching, that were objectively successful under tougher conditions.  It is just that this school just wants something different, and isn't very good at articulating why or delivering support through management.  This for me has been a valuable lesson, when a teacher is struggling it's more than likely its the school's fault not the teacher's.\n\nIf you are struggling as a teacher, please do not give up on teaching, find a school that appreciates you.  It's a New Year, and a perfect time to find a place that is the right fit for you.\n\nAgain Happy New Years.",

      "selftext": "Hi all, this is my first time posting anything and I'm just looking for a bit of advice and information more than anything.\n\nI graduated and achieved my PGCE mid-2024 after a long struggle. I had a turbulent training experience and didn't have a particularly beneficial relationship with my mentor and it ended up impacting my mental health massively to the point of a relapse in my health and behaviour privately. \n\nA lot of the strain in that relationship was due to different teaching styles - my mentor was a lot stricter and had quite a rigid teaching persona, which was not something I wanted for my own teaching style (and actually found very difficult & unnatural to replicate!). For me, it wasn't a good way of establishing relationships especially as a newer teacher in some of their classes. This ended up causing a fair bit of friction and passive-aggression and I can't lie and say it didn't impact my confidence as a teacher.\n\nTo be frank, I've been put off. Even with the qualification and degree at my side, I am not confident in my abilities and decided for the sake of my mental health (sanity & survival) that immediately pursuing an ECT career was not the best decision for me. Teaching is what I  love & want to do, but I also want to be in a stable state of mind to be able to teach these kids to the best of my ability. My experiences have made me feel like this may never be possible. \n\nSo, I'm looking for information - what are the 'rules', I suppose, around taking a 'break' from teaching (I suppose before it even started)? Do I have a limit on when I can complete my ECTs? Have I made a silly decision that I cannot come back from, thus essentially making this qualification void? Or, can I attempt to come back to it anytime in the future?\n\nApologies for such a long post & it's massively appreciated that you've read it. Any advice is welcome but I'm clearly a sensitive soul lol, so go easy on me! \n\nTa very much! ",

But had a friend with a different agency on \u00a3165 a day (!!) at the same time. When I got a job with my own class I asked for more money as this would be a lot more work (now responsible for reports and planning etc). The agency said it would depend if the school were able to pay more but really wouldn't it have been if they were willing to take a smaller cut? (I got a \u00a35 a day raise sigh)\nIn passing I've heard comments from heads/senior leaders about paying hundreds per day.\nSo - what does a school pay for a supply teachers?\nWhy don't more teachers/schools just work directly with each other to save money?\nSay a school pays an agency \u00a3200 and the teacher gets \u00a3120 of that.\nIf the school and teacher linked up without the agency the teacher could make \u00a3150 and be on more money while the school is also saving money?\nIs there a reason this isn't done? \n\nThanks to anyone willing to share!",

School is decent and expectations aren't great. People are pretty positive in the school too. \n\nI was in a promited post and just didn't like dealing with teachers to be honest. Always moaning so I didn't apply when the post became permanent which I don't regret. \n\nSince then, I've just gone in, done my job and gone home. I don't give homework really so workload isn't a huge issue. \n\nAnyone else felt like this? Even behaviour isn't excessively bad. I'm 34 by the way so maybe this is a phase?! ",

      "selftext": "I\u2019m a TA in a small village primary school. There are less than 20 children in the whole school split into Early Years (3-4yr old) Class 1 (6-8yr old) and Class 2 (8-12yr old) the 12 year old is behind due to missing significant school time due to home issues. We also have a \u201cnurture room\u201d where 3 children are placed with their 1-to-1 TAs. There is no qualified teacher in this room. \n\nI am often in the nurture room. One child in particular is very violent, punching, kicking, biting, spitting. He is only 8 years old but he is almost as strong as I am and has hurt me many times by throwing chairs and toys at me. I am often asked to be his 1 to 1 because apparently he responds well to me, but I spend most of my day following him around while he destroys school property and spits at me. There is no work set for him, he has no routine. I have been told by the head not to even try to get him to engage in learning and I should just let him do whatever he wants and get him through the school day without harming himself or others. This has been set by the head and she has blown up on another TA who tried to get him to do a fun worksheet she found online. The child gets bored easily and when he is bored he becomes destructive, no amount of trying to distract him with toys and games can stop him from destroying school property. The window replacement budget in this school must be astronomical because at least one window is smashed weekly. I don\u2019t even get a break and have to eat my lunch with him, if I need the toilet I have to radio for another TA to come and cover for me because he can\u2019t be left alone for a second. There are no punishments or consequences for this child, and sending him to the heads office does nothing. He climbed a tree one day and when I called for the head for support he said \u201cI like being sent to the head teachers office, she gives me a hug and a hot chocolate\u201d.\n\nIs this normal? I used to love working with Class 1 until this child started and I became his punching bag/babysitter. I feel bad for him because if he continues without any education or guidance he\u2019ll never have any sort of life outside of an institution. \n\nI love the small village school and most of the staff are lovely. I\u2019ve been working there since mid September and I\u2019m starting to feel like part of the team, but the last month or so has me dreading the day and worrying about what I\u2019ll have to endure.

I knew this was going to be rubbish so I bought lots of snacks, drinks, disposable cups and plates etc. I wrote them all a Christmas card with a drawing in (I'm the art teacher). The party was chaos. We couldn't get through the quiz we were asked to do just because of the intense screaming. I left 5 minutes to clear rubbish, which meant put on coats and stand there with filthy tables for some. I had to shout at them to clean which felt negative. I saw some of my Christmas cards in the bin and felt sad.\n\nI stood at the door to wish them a Merry Christmas and they couldn't be quiet.

I\u2019m usually not the best chatter. School exhausts me too much to hold a conversation but then again when I do, I either would try to get to know the person or their day to the extent to which they interested in sharing such when we\u2019re on lunch break and or ugh on the bus. Anyway this Christmas I gave everyone a card (I wrote each one a personalised message inside) and had some treats in the classroom where our team could enjoy them, and then I even went to the extent of buying coffee pods for my line manager and the principal (I mean these two helped me a lot to apply for my visa and in the recent meeting I had with them, I communicated that I wanted to be train internally before I apply for Assessment only QTS and they were again very supportive) which obviously our team doesn\u2019t know about. I mean even when I had to leave a present, I\u2019m so awkward that I just left it on their desks so I don\u2019t have to be there for them to thank me for it that\u2019s how awkward I am. When I left school today I left with bags of presents from kids while they got none, but even before they saw me with a bag of presents some people are erm a little less friendly. I\u2019ve been out with the staffs a couple of times- to sum up the highlights of each night out of drink, once I went out, I shared embarrassing videos on the group (I guess that was not funny I realised it later- since people are grown ups, they let themselves loose and don\u2019t want to look at it later. In my country we\u2019d make fun of them for days so I didn\u2019t get that), another time I was a bit too drunk and dropped a few glasses and fell once and the third time (and this is solely with my team) I was on my third drink and I was loud and they were very judgey. In my point of view when you\u2019re comfortable with people, you try to relax but I guess I\u2019m starting to become this person who\u2019s the weirdo who cannot handle a drink, cannot hold a conversation or at least I don\u2019t have anything to add about kids, grandkids, family since I\u2019m away from home and got nothing new happening, nothing or no colleague to back bitch about- I\u2019m easy maybe I\u2019m the colleague they back bitch about. \nAnyway tomorrow I\u2019m going out for dinner with my team and I although I want to drink, I no longer feel comfortable doing so. Does anyone else relate? What can I do a bit more to get along? I really don\u2019t want to suck up to them which I don\u2019t, maybe I could ask a bit more about their day but honestly like I said Im not very good at small talks either ugh. \n",

It is her. \n\nMy head went to a union rep and discussed me, it was the wrong union. Then said I would have a follow up meeting on my return.

It was all over by lunchtime the same day and they concluded the allegation was unfounded. I was back in the classroom that afternoon.\n\nEven though it was resolved quickly, it had a huge impact on my mental health. My anxiety was through the roof for weeks. I struggled to sleep, thinking I was a bad teacher, that I could lose my job, and that my colleagues might think differently of me. I became so self-conscious in the classroom, worried I\u2019d say the wrong thing, that I ended up being pretty quiet and reserved for a while.\n\nThis was over a year ago now, and I still teach the same student. Recently, they\u2019ve made a complaint that I ignore them and treat them differently from the rest of the class.\n\nI\u2019ll admit there\u2019s some truth in their feelings. While I do check in with them during lessons, mark their work frequently and they regularly come to my weekly after-school intervention sessions, I don\u2019t chit-chat or try to be overly friendly with them. That\u2019s partly because I\u2019m still cautious after what happened and don\u2019t want to say anything they might take the wrong way. But I can understand why they might feel like they\u2019re being treated differently, even if it\u2019s unintentional on my part.\n\nIn a meeting today, I was repeatedly asked how I can make this student feel more included. I honestly didn\u2019t know what to say other than explaining what I already do.\n\nWhat would you do? If a student made an unfounded allegation about you, how would you rebuild that relationship?

They\u2019ve obviously not taken that seriously.\n\nThey have complained they are \u2018bored\u2019. I\u2019m taking away their last remaining breaks and lunch this term, but one member of SLT has said in the new year he\u2019ll look to open up the sports hall on the proviso they use the correct toilets and behave themselves.\n\n95% of me thinks, why go to the effort for them? There\u2019s plenty of things they could do, they don\u2019t need to behave this way, they do it because they think it\u2019s big and clever. But 5% thinks, maybe they need some carrot as well as stick. After all, I\u2019ve rather run out of threats to throw at them.\n\nLove to hear your thoughts and suggestions.",

Took ages to settle, were rowdy, were playing dumb noises and sound effects on their Chromebooks.  I had to send two kids out.  What was the worst bit was two kids who weren't with me for registration who just poured sustained abuse at me.  I should have phoned for the on-call senior staff but how can that even be possible if I am trying to keep the rest of the class safe.  By the end of the lesson thanks to these two boys the room was anarchy.\n\nI managed to dismiss the class but as I was leaving these same two boys continued to shout at me.  There was nothing I could do.  I maintained my composure until I got to the front office and then burst into tears.  I was advised to go home after that.\n\nI feel like a total failure of a teacher and I'm really annoyed at the school for relying on a supply teacher's personal phone to get on call SLT down to where they're needed.  I'm only doing the supply teaching to fund living expenses whilst I study but at this point I'm wondering if I'd be better off applying for some shifts at a supermarket.

Myself and the other class teachers differ in teaching styles and support given (I like giving pupils vocabulary lists to increase independence and reduce the questions I\u2019m asked, whereas the other teachers I share with prefer the kids to repeatedly see a word in a text until they learn it by osmosis).

I believe there was also a concern raised that schools would find something else to fill the time with if it wasn't cover. \n\nHowever, the STPCD is statutory guidance which means that schools who choose to follow it are legally bound to follow its conditions. This puts, according to the numbers replying to the last question, the majority of schools into tricky legal territory over this. \n\nHowever, does it matter? \n\nAre schools taking liberties?\n\nDo we accept it as a net positive?\n\nIs it a matter of principle to make sure the STPCD is adhered to?\n\nShould the STPCD be altered to reflect the current reality?",

      "selftext": "Teaching is a profession that requires a lot of administrative work: marking books (all books every month is by pledge, averaging at more than 2 classes a week), planning, organising trips, pastoral and safeguarding logs etc. \n\nI believe one of the reasons why retention of new teachers is low is due to the fact you\u2019re often in a high-stress, somewhat pressured environment. There are very high expectations placed upon teachers to meet the deadlines, however, the time you should be allocated to complete this work is continually used/changed at the last minute. It\u2019s a very fast-paced work environment that doesn\u2019t really allow for personal space \u2014 if it\u2019s not duty, then it\u2019s KS3 pupils knocking at your door to drop their bag in your classroom, or answering a barrage of questions if they catch you at your desk. \n\nFor example, on a 5-period day I have meetings scheduled in to my 15-minute break (that last the entire break), and also duty standing at a lunch line. There\u2019s not much time to \u201crelax\u201d in that 4-5 hour window \u2014 and when I say relax, I mean having a moment to get a drink or use the bathroom. We also run lunchtime clubs which then roll onto the next period, leaving about 10 minutes to eat. \n\nAdditionally, I\u2019ve noticed an increasing level of cover set during free periods and at the last minute. On one occasion, I\u2019d set up my desk to get on with some marking (only to realise I\u2019d been put on cover). Once I made it to the classroom, the pupils had been moved to a computer room at the other side of the school; this meant I was 20 minutes into that free period before I could even begin working for myself, and even then I\u2019d left my marking in my classroom. \n\nI realise we finish teaching relatively early (3:30) but it still feels like an intense physical workload during the school day. \n\nI love teaching but often feel completely physically worn out by the end of the day, with hardly any time during the day to have quiet time for myself to focus. \n\nHas anyone else thought about this before?

      "selftext": "Hi all. \n\nI'm a new HoD (started in September) and feel like it's not going great. There are improvements to be made on curriculum, results and teaching and I'm trying really hard to prioritise. The department has had a period of unrest and lots has changed, so I've spent the first term trying to get to know the team, get people on side etc. I'm introducing changes, but incrementally and with reflection time, and I have a long term plan for improvement. Given that the entire curriculum has pretty much been replaced I need to give the department time to get used to this, and I'm reluctant to introduce too many initiatives when it'll mean they're only minimally implemented. \n\nTrouble is SLT is on my case and I feel like I'm being strong armed into doing things I don't think are going to work. Constant learning walks, fortnightly book scrutinies, extra weekly training for my team, 'linking in' with other departments that have 'improved rapidly.' Essentially I've been told to get moving fast. \n\nI'm reflecting on it all ahead of the new year so I can try to get some better systems in place. Any tips from anyone on the other side of this all? I want to improve the department and prove my salt but I also want to protect my department (and my own sanity, frankly...I'm working 14 hour days six days a week and hardly see my kid.) ",

Many people find the offloading cathartic and helps them \"move on\".\n\nSome people however (myself included!) feel the opposite. When I have a bad lesson I just want to move on and having someone venting at me about students that I also teach is exhausting. I've got them next and now my lunch time has to be taken up with hearing about how shit they were last lesson.\n\nSometimes I will just have my lunch elsewhere to avoid it.\n\nI understand that venting in the staffroom is important for many staff members but should we be thinking of those who find it difficult to always be talking about certain students?\n\nThanks for reading!",

However, recently we\u2019ve been told that the current cover situation is becoming a problem and so they\u2019re going to have to be stricter on requests for cover/special leave. \n\nWe were told that all requests would still be looked at and considered but at the moment it feels like everything is being rejected no matter what. From Christmas concerts, appointments, courses, driving test and even a funeral. I don\u2019t know anyone who\u2019s had a request actually approved since the announcement.\n\nI know that time off for things like this come under the discretion of the headteacher anyway and they are technically well within their rights to deny requests like these but it just seems a bit over the top. Idk if it\u2019s relevant but we have 3/4 cover supervisors and I don\u2019t really see any outside supply staff coming in regularly either so don\u2019t understand cover being so bad they have to implement a crack down??\n\nIdk I guess it just feels harsh on the run up to Christmas. Like if they wanted to change the current policy wouldn\u2019t it have been better to announce it at the end of last year and start fresh in September instead of announcing it on the run up to Christmas?

Let them take their shoes off during intervention to \u2018chill\u2019\n2. Let them swing on their chair\n3. Buy them chocolates and other nice things\n4. Let them wear their jackets \n5.

      "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nPerhaps a bit unorthodox to post as you don\u2019t know my personal circumstances etc. BUT I am soon returning to work from maternity leave and wondering what others have done in terms of flexible working/part-time work.\n\nI was HOD of my core subject for just under 2 years when I went on maternity leave. Working long hours but managed to stick to normal core working hours of 7-5 when pregnant. Have always done some work on a Sunday to prepare for the week.\n\nI\u2019m curious what other mums (ideally those who have some responsibility so can weigh in on that) have done to balance returning to work.\n\nI\u2019m considering:\n- Giving up my TLR and working 3 days. Fully prioritising family and letting my career sit back. \n- Returning PT and keeping my TLR (this depends on what my head will allow)\n- Returning PT and requesting other TLR in my department with potentially less work/responsibility\n\nI\u2019m concerned about: \n- Returning and not being \u2018in charge\u2019. I think my ego would struggle going from making the decisions to having to follow someone else\u2019s vision/logic\n- Wanting to \u2018have it all\u2019 but burning out \n- Missing out on my child whilst they\u2019re still little as this only happens once  \n\nAny thoughts/experiences/judgement more than welcome. Help me! \n\nEdit: to be clear, I\u2019m curious what others have done in other schools rather than asking you to decide for me! ",

I am given extra time to do this and overall it just gets done in my time out. No issues on that even though our planning is quite regimented.\n\nBoth supplies took on the roles to do no planning but share assessment and we're supposed to do IEPs etc but our SEND team ended up doing those for them. Both teachers are female and elderly. Our entire team is new except me. Been teaching 10 years. No staff meetings for them as the refuse to go I think. On occasion one is particularly abrupt to me but ive been told this is how she is. Teachers known to a lot of middle management so have friends at school. The class TA next door feels a bit lost even though I have tried to help. I mentioned this to slt.\n\nI was off ill all last week (me then the kiddo) and came back to a little pocket of fires today. I wasnt there to explain and print last week.\n\n.My main issue how much the supplies question everything, get stressed when I'm not in early enough (prior commitments and care at home mean I get in 8.20 but I've done this in the last full year) often don't do the quality of work we expect and ask for certain things on the ppts. I send all the planning and PowerPoint each Friday morning which are detailed with notes and discuss when I come in. A lot of the explaining and printing takes up a lot of time anyway. Everything for the next day is always printed ready and TAs get this sorted but it can be hectic as we have lots of resources. Our asst head left detailed notes for these two last year and it was still done incorrectly. I'm constantly reminding them to look through the lesson when they ask questions which are already answered on there.  I was a supply for 2 years as an nqt  both long and short term so I understand the pressures but also coped much better with less support than I am currently giving them.\n\nWent to speak to our SLT about this to find a smooth way of working and all of this is apparently happening because I come in at 8.20. Explained personal reasons and it was suggested chats happen after school instead which I can do. Called a meeting with them both for tomor afternoon and the abrupt one mentioned last week was fine and I should not say it wasnt otherwise. I wasnt spoke to very respectfully to be honest.  I was trying to fix and help our year group but got that back.\n\nNot sure where to go from here as we have a full 2 terms of this left. I don't feel supported and I feel everyone's desperate to help anyone else that isn't me. I'm also leading Science which is chunky.\n\nWe are a good school on paper.

There has never been any management support, I have been told to get on with it, grow a backbone, be more resilient etc.\n\nI found myself another job in another school setting and handed my notice in a few weeks ago. I'm currently working my notice period.\n\nMajority of the staff have always been less than friendly towards me but since handing my notice in things seem to have escalated- every day I am having comments made towards me by colleagues as well as behind my back, that I am a waste of space, useless at my job, unable to manage SEN children, that I have failed, that I need my head kicked in. Just to name a few. A few days ago I walked into the staff room to find a group of colleagues laughing about me, they didn't stop when I walked in.\n\nI feel numb, emotional and incredibly sad about the whole situation. I love the children I work with and ultimately that's why I have stayed in this environment for so long but I am broken and a shell of the person I used to be. I only have a week and a half left but I'm not sure I can face it. I'm contemplating getting signed off for the last part of the term but I can't shake the feeling that I'm letting people down.\n\nI think I know what the right thing to do is deep down but think maybe I just need someone else to say it.

I\u2019ve got three sets of KS3 classes, and all of them have reading and writing assessments that need marking. On top of that, there\u2019s the trial data for my Year 11s, which had to be marked at the same time. It feels like there\u2019s just no breathing room.  \n\nTo add to the stress, I was recently observed (for my ECT requirements) with my Year 8s. They\u2019re notoriously badly behaved across the school and consistently try and fight against sanctions. I've been working closely on them with my HoD, who suggested I try a behaviour \" reset\" with the class, and come down hard with them and my expectations. I went for it, but now in my formal ECT observation and feedback with my ECT Coordinator, I\u2019ve been described as \u201cunkind and frankly draconian.\u201d  \n\nThis has completely cut me. Never in my life have I been told I\u2019m unkind. In fact since starting at the school, my HoD has previously said I\u2019m \"too nice/soft\" with behaviour and need to be firmer with the students. I just feel like I can\u2019t win\u2014when I\u2019m lenient, I\u2019m too nice; when I try to enforce stricter boundaries, I\u2019m seen as harsh.  \n\nI\u2019m so tired and stressed, and my morale is at rock bottom....  I\u2019m questioning if I\u2019m doing the right thing by being here. I care so much about my students, and I want to do my best for them, but I\u2019m starting to doubt myself and my ability to keep up with everything.  \n\nHow do other ECTs or teachers deal with this? Does it get better? How do you manage to balance being firm without crossing the line into being perceived as unkind?  \n",

Other teacher was slamming doors and things into tables etc, and has made it very clear they do not believe I did not 'snitch' on them. \n\nOther teacher has spent 2 days last week acting very aggressive towards me. If I am in the vicinity, they slam stuff about talking about how pissed off they are that 'someone has snitched'. \n\nOther colleague is well liked and people agree they are hard done by that 'someone snitched'. \n\nIf I complain about how aggressive and intimidating they have being towards me, I fear making it worse.

      "title": "Controlling HLTA",
      "selftext": "Morning,\n\nI am looking for advice on how to navigate this situation. \nI\u2019ve recently joined a school and I am still learning how things work at that school. The headteacher is very specific about the policies to a point where it\u2019s almost pedantic. I\u2019ve adjusted well, despite not always being informed until the last minute.\nI am very lucky to have an experienced HLTA in my class (over 20 years) but I don\u2019t like the way they offer support. If I make a decision and they feel differently, they won\u2019t respect my decision - they\u2019ll just change what I\u2019m doing. For example, if I give instructions and set children on a particular task, if they don\u2019t like the task (or sometimes they get confused about the instructions and don\u2019t listen carefully to my explanation), they\u2019ll tell the children to stop doing it and do something else. When I\u2019m teaching, they\u2019ll tell interrupt me to repeat the last thing I said in slightly different words. I adjusted part of the behaviour policy to suit the age of my children, they stopped me in the middle of an instruction, apologised to the children as if I got it wrong and gave them different instructions. I spoke to the headteachers, they said I was fine with the behaviour policy change and I could continue. When I quietly relayed this to the HLTA, they said they would talk to the headteacher instead and continued to give out the other instruction.\nWhen they were on PPA, they were sat outside the classroom with the door open. I closed it because some children were doing assessments outside and I felt monitored. The HLTA opened it again. As its Christmas, I said the children could do their Christmas decorations and we watch a movie but the HLTA barrelled into the classroom, saying no, we needed to do something else instead. They spoke over me and told the children we wouldn\u2019t be doing what I said then went back to PPA.\nI haven\u2019t said much to them about it before because I was new to everything and appreciated the guidance at times. However, they are constantly override my decisions and undermining my authority in the classroom in front of the children. It really slows lesson pacing down and we are extremely behind. When I first came, the children wouldn\u2019t even respond to my behaviour management because they recognised them as the only authority. Now I\u2019ve had more opportunities to be the only adult in the classroom, the children respond quickly to me and I have built good relationships (esp with more challenging children). I have been more assertive with my decisions and have stated that this is what I\u2019m going to do. They don\u2019t seem happy about it.\n\nMoving forward, I want to write up a plan of the HLTA responsibilities and my responsibilities as classroom leader. The plan will include the ares of support needed, mostly on supporting children that are behind or challenging children that are completing work quickly. I also plan to list the ways that I run the classroom so that it is clearer and there will be more consistency between us. I am going to Cc the headteachers into the email. Is this appropriate or is there another more appropriate course of action?\n\nTLDR: Overbearing controlling HLTA interrupts lessons and undermines me in front of the children. I want to write up a plan to tell them what their role is vs mine and how I manage the classroom. Is this okay?",

Point blank shut down the idea of this ever happening. \n\nThis has made teachers nervous to reapproch the idea and has also waved a red flag at the matter. \n\nWe think that this might actually illegal to refuse having a rep?

To give you a little background, I have had mental health issues most of my life, including from adolescence, I have always wanted to be a teacher but thought I wasn't good enough. Finally in my mid-30's I plucked up the courage and got a place on a 3-7 SCITT course. My first placement started really well, my mentor is an amazing teacher and is also SLT. However as time has passed, my mentor is spending less time in the classroom and leaving me to cover her. Last week I spent 2 full teaching days on my own with no support. I know she has a lot on her plate but I have spoken to her before about feeling cut off and overwhelmed.\n\n Yesterday, I spent most of the day alone with the class, which is fine and I didn't get overwhelmed until home time, suddenly I was confronted by a angry parent about a missing coat, she was even more angry when I asked for him to go a look over in the school garden area, as though I was supposed to leave 20+ Year 1's to run off so I could go find a coat. My mentor was very dismissive and told me to \"forget about it\" and quickly left for a meeting. I am just about coping with the planning and paperwork but this has really upset me. The only thing I am being pulled up for is my classroom management, my mentor feels I am not stopping the low level chatter quickly enough. I have spoken to my SCITT provider and will have a meeting on Monday but I'm just really low and feeling pretty alone. Anyone else had similar experiences?",

However, during my last lesson that afternoon, they were very chatty, and some students were quite rude and disruptive. I really struggled to get their attention.\n\nTo make matters worse, I overheard the TA in the room talking negatively about me to the class teacher, which made me feel pretty grim and just threw me off. \n\nLater on, the TA then interrupted me to try and get the class to be quiet but they didn't really pay attention to her either lol.\n\nBy the end of the lesson, I couldn\u2019t get the class to quiet down, so I decided not to try shouting over them to say goodbye. The class teacher didn\u2019t mention that it was my last day during dismissal either, so I left without properly saying goodbye to any of them.\n\nOverall, my placement has been a mostly positive experience, and my end-of-placement review was good. That said, I\u2019ve found it challenging at times\u2014especially with the TA, as this isn\u2019t the first negative encounter I\u2019ve had with her. I\u2019m trying not to take it personally, as I\u2019ve noticed she speaks poorly about nearly everyone in the school behind their backs.\n\nI guess I\u2019m just feeling guilty for not saying goodbye to the class properly. I'm very conscious of appearing odd or unusual and I'm worried it was the wrong etiquette to leave without saying anything. (For info: I said thanks and goodbye to both the teacher and the TA and got them a card and a gift each).\n\nI know I'm overthinking this, but I think it just felt like a pretty miserable end to the placement. Especially when I heard about other people on my cohort having lovely last days.\n\nAny advice on how to handle this or move past it?\n\nETA: Thanks for replying. I do realise that it just isn't a massive deal to the kids. I've been worrying it looked like I was odd for not saying bye to them so these comments have been helpful!\n\nI think hearing the TA slag me off just made me feel a bit worse about thing.

      "selftext": "Hi, \n\nHas anyone had any success using chatgpt to give feedback  to GCSE geography students? I can feed it the criteria, model answers and it understands how to produce a 12 mark answer. It can then give feedback on my answer if i give it to it. It can also remember this the next week. \n\nGCSE geography is so formulaic in how to write answers that it seems like a feedback machine could be created using chatgpt. You just need to feed it criteria and model answers - which the students produce all the time. \n\nThere are various problems to overcome:\n\n1. You can't network chatgpt - it would be good if - just like google classroom I could see everyone in the class inputting their answers to the chatgpt that i have created (and trained through the above). But this doesn't exist. I can't access a students chatgpt. It's not networked. \n\n2. The students can cheat, they could just input answers that chatgt has written. \n\nFor 1 - I could give them all the criteria and instructions that trains the Gpt to be a good feedback machine, and then they paste that into their own chatgpt. \n\nFor 2: I could get them all to write their answers into a google doc collaboratively - live in the classroom - and then paste it into chatgpt - and it would give me the feedback  on those answers - and if they added the names it will (i think) remember each student - so next time it happens it will learn more about each student. \n\nI understand this is already done with Maths. So does anyone know of - is there a geography gcse AI? \n\nIsn't feedback one of the most effective things for learning. Well I imagine a pupill doing a 6 mark question at home - then uploading it - then getting instant feedback - then improving it - then getting instant feedback.  Also chatgpt can get to know you, so if you are doing this regularly - it will get to know the person and how they are doing and then start to give more and more personalised feedback. (obvs theres privacy issues to this and whether people agree to feeding the computer.) \n\nIf the AI was networked it would also have an extremely good idea of what a 6 mark answer to ... is. As it will have hundreds - no thousands of answers. And then it can mark exams for us as well. \n\nI assume there's loads of people working towards this? \n\nkind regards, \n\n\n\n",

I reported it but it wasn\u2019t addressed and not being a formal class teacher they don\u2019t show me the respect in general, today the group of boys have been making comments along that vein and it escalated to a point where one of the boys in the middle of a class just outright said \u201cMr X has a crush on someone in this high school, one of the kids\u201d now it was intended as a joke but frankly, as a man, jokes of this nature are not exactly ones I\u2019d want to entertain, I told the child that wasn\u2019t appropriate but then I was pulled to deal with a team teach issue so couldn\u2019t press it further before the end of the day. Do I approach the head of year with this or escalate to DSL and get union involved. \n\nHere\u2019s my concern, if any of the students don\u2019t take that as a joke and report it before I do, as a man I\u2019m already fighting an uphill battle, the nature of the comment will leave preconceptions for anyone dealing with the issue and I\u2019d like to get ahead of this if it is needed to get ahead so how would you approach this situation, who would you involve and speak to?",

We use Rising Stars for assessment (done termly) and I disagree with the assessment of a number of children in my class. They got over half the marks in the arithmetic but scored less than a quarter of the marks in the problem solving papers. This mirrors my teacher assessment as these children try hard and follow in class but have a general lack of understanding of maths. I have recorded them as Working Towards the standard.\n\nI've already made comments about the way maths is taught and the limited success of our supposed 'interventions' (low qualified TAs simply parroting procedures at them repeatedly). Yet their scores on these assessments are an accumulation of the arithmetic and the problem solving papers and, due to their attainment in the arithmetic, they have JUST achieved \"expected\". Therefore my school want me to record them as 'Expected\". \n\nI disagree. These children don't demonstrate any reasonable ability to process mathematical concepts. But they can 'just about' pass exams entirely based on the processes they've spent the preceding weeks been drilled on (reliant on daily interventions, which take place during foundation lessons, so children miss science, music, art, history etc).\n\nMy school are defending their position with a ton of \"recent evidence\" of their approach showing a huge improvement in maths attainment. \n\nI am dubious. \n\nIf 'attainment' means they've passed the exams, then I have first hand experience of how that really doesn't compute with a secure understanding of basic mathematical concepts. Let alone the 'rounded education' our school states on its website.\n\nThis issue seems to be widespread amongst my trust. Am I wrong?

Doing a little bit of admin you forgot in the evening is one thing, but to spend evenings marking work because you are fully timetabled with very few free periods (this is a very serious issue in our science department with 3-4 teachers already giving notice. \n\n  \nIn the end, something has to give right? We are losing so many teachers through burnout and the ridiculous work schedule. Personally, If I was education secretary, I would either stipulate that all schools finish the school day at 2pm so teachers have that time to mark and prepare for lessons, or, move to a four day week. The four day week is now becoming more prevalent in industry and when I first started teaching, I deliberately asked for four days because I was fortunate enough to be able to afford it and it did wonders for my wellbeing. \n\nI really do fear that we are now past breaking point and we are just seeing the education sector crumble.

But then towards the middle and end it began to fall apart. Low level disruption grew into constant interruptions. I was struggling to keep a track of which students I had given sanctions to, as I need to actually teach the content. \n\nThere was also a technical issue when I was trying to draw my graph on the visualiser - I couldn\u2019t get it to work on the PowerPoint like I planned (which had the data on the slide along with the visualiser). So then I was conscious the kids wouldn\u2019t be able to see the table of data alongside the bar chart I was modelling how to draw and in the minute or two whilst I solved it (presented it another way) chaos ensued. Using a visualiser is a lot more difficult than I anticipated, especially under pressure. Student was sent out - I had asked my mentor to remove him earlier but she said I need to go through the behaviour policy first. Eventually I went through the behaviour policy - didn\u2019t work and he was removed. \n\nCan anyone give advice or tips ? Managing behaviour is so difficult. I\u2019m not a very stern person and I don\u2019t want to run my lessons on fear and punishment, but I\u2019m also concerned that if I try to constantly positive praise without facing reality the kids will see me as weak. I have tried writing a list of names on the board to keep track of sanctions, but that has been seen by observers as creating a negative atmosphere potentially. I think maybe I should create a private list on my own notepad - but it is hard to teach and manage a class and attend to this list. I would say usually positive praise is a strength of mine and I am able to make kids feel respected and included.",

Behaviour has always been an issue in these schools, but there was a behaviour system in place and consequencess that had an impact. \n\nOne thing I'm really struggling to wrap my head around is behaviour, and attitudes towards behaviour from the government, which in turn impacts school. \n\nI know the government recommends relational approaches that combine high expectations and high warmth, and that restorative practice can supposedly lead to better behaviour. But what about consequence for negative behaviours?\n\nI don't know how this approach has manifest itself in other schools, (if you could share your experience on how it works I'd be really grateful) but it feels detrimental to progress and learning in the school I'm currently at. \n\nI don't mean to be deliberately contentious but I'm struggling to see the merits of this approach. Obviously there is a place for restorative practice, I've done so in previous schools. And I agree, relationships are key to teaching. That goes without saying.  But, in the school I'm currently at, I feel students are all too aware of this approach, which has in turn meant they take advantage of it. \nWithout consequence, how can we build a proper learning environment? \n\nSanctions are almost non-existent, and detentions  after school don't exist. In my previous experience I've set high expectations in every lesson and push the pupils to be the best they can. Naturally I've had push back but in the end I've always built positive relationships. \n\nHowever, I feel my hands are tied here in Scotland. I don't necessarily think detentions are punitive;  but I'm really struggling to adapt my teaching within the framework here.\n\nTL;DR without students having a proper understanding of consequence, how can we make for a good learning environment? \n\nHow does the Scottish model actually play out in your day to day experience in the classroom? \n\n\n\n",

      "selftext": "I've been thinking a lot about how to best teach my low ability year 5 class. They've come up to me as barely able to write and barely able to do enough, which means completely replanning how I normally teach a year 5 cohorts; sadly, the lack of ability has also made them incredibly apathetic to things like writing online, performing numbers correctly, et cetera. Because they're slow and unmotivated, we often do not cover a complete curriculum and are usually behind in our units. In my heart of hearts, I want to be a fun, engaging teacher who's going to make learning enjoyable for them; however, there are only so many times I can talk to a child about writing on the line or putting the number 5 in the right way rounds before it starts to get to me. I find myself incredibly unmotivated. I feel like I need help with this cohort.\n\nEven when I've given engaging lessons a try, such as dressing up and role play, concrete resources, Etcetera, we quickly have significant low-level disruption, which I cannot deal with by myself. Fights are common, as are children walking out of lessons and refusing to come in the morning. I have 6 traveller children with less than 50% attendance whom I am expected to integrate if/when they show up fully. I often can't teach a full input because people will talk over me - I'm not even a new teacher; I've been teaching for 19 years, and I have never known behaviour to be this bad. Attempted discussions with SLT on what I can do to foster a positive relationship with my class have been responded to with \"keep smiling and get on with it.\" I love the school, and moving on is not an option due to my childcare commitments.\n\n I'm already pushingin 60-pluss hours a week to replan the curriculum that should have been good to go, and when I compare myself to my previous year in year 5, I just feel like I'm going immensely wrong. I have tried voicing my concerns to my slt but they have simply told me that I should focus on making sure the children are happy and the small steps they are taking will be enough. I understand this but part of me just wishes we could have more fun with our learning.\n\n  \nAny thoughts?",

It screams panic appointing, because looking at their CV they are woefully unfit to fill this role.\n\nWe are entering mock GCSE fortnight and, as a practical subject, there is a lot of planning and preparation required. I covered one of their Y11 classes recently so was catching up with pupils on their development and prep for their mock. Only two pupils had a clue as to what they were going to do, most had no plan, some didn\u2019t even know what they were meant to be doing in the mock. None are up to date with their portfolios. Some told me that the HoD had not spoken to them in *weeks*. \n\nThe same concerns have been shared from the Y13 group about her ability and experience. Fortunately I have 50% of their timetable so they are at least up to date and have been *taught*.\n\nI am fairly new to the school (September 2023) and had an excellent relationship with my previous HoD, who was also young but *amazing* at her job. The difference in ability between her and the new HoD is startling. \n\nMy question\u2026do I approach SLT with my concerns and potentially create an awkward and uncomfortable atmosphere in the department? I have spoken to her several times to make it clear that there are things she\u2019s not doing (in as polite a way as I can!) but there\u2019s little I can do to make things better for the students who are being impacted by her poor teaching. She\u2019s being put through QTS assessment only as her qualifications are from overseas, so I have made her assessor and mentor aware. \n\nI\u2019m just tired of mopping up after her and worrying about how poorly these kids are being taught.",

      "selftext": "I have recently started working at an FE college and although the attitude of learners resitting English and Maths is to be expected somewhat, the attitude of the staff has surprised me. \n\nFor those that don't know, learners that have not passed their GCSE Maths or GCSE English but are seeking to do vocational courses like T-levels or diplomas in brickwork, hair and beauty, sports, catering, automotive etc have to resit Maths/English until they are 18. The government funds their vocational course and learners do 3 hours of Maths and/or English a week. These learners often struggled in traditional education and are seeking a more practical form of education. As such they hate having to do Maths and English.\n\nIn the college I'm currently in, an alarming number of  learners avoid attending Maths/English classes and of those that do, their behavior and attitude in class is very rude. It's normal to have a few learners that disengage, but the amount of learners who are disruptive, destroy materials, throw things in class, talk over teachers and other students, treat the classroom like their personal canteen, play games one their phone or listen to music or watch movies in class is shocking. Over half of the learners in each class act like this and the few that want to learn are so fed up that they begin to disengage as well. \n\nStaff already working here say \"Attendance is always bad in these colleges\", \"Up and down the country their behaviour is like this\" But is this true? I worked in an FE college just 4 years ago and things were never this bad. Has it really gotten worse? Is this behaviour the norm?",

      "selftext": "For context, I\u2019m in Scotland, and I gather that the approach to behaviour management is generally a bit different to England. So I\u2019d appreciate Scottish views especially (but, please, all opinions welcome!)\n\nI have a particularly rowdy S2 class. I share them with the HoD and they\u2019re a fairly big class when all present. Of course, they behave like angels for her. This class is the source of most of my dissatisfaction. \n\nThe school doesn\u2019t have any official \u2018behaviour policy\u2019 or sanctions. I can re-room pupils during lessons (not that this is a sanction). However this usually ends up as being more hassle for me because as soon as the lesson ends, I will be interrogated as to why I re-roomed that pupil by HoD. Was the material differentiated enough? Did I welcome them into the classroom effusively enough? Did I give them multiple warnings? Was the starter task engaging enough? \n\nI can send a text home, but HoD discourages this as they prefer to keep this measure for more persistent and/ or serious instances. I really don\u2019t have anything else. Every other sanction has to go through, or be decided by her. Detentions aren\u2019t an official thing and are not be well received by HoD. I gave a detention to a group of pupils who walked away after I asked them to stay behind for poor behaviour. Imo, this is complete insolence and absolutely detention-worthy. However, they went begging to her and she cancelled the detention! \n\nThere\u2019s no system of \u2018levels\u2019 or \u2018stages\u2019. The HoD\u2019s ultimate response to any indiscipline issue is - are my relationships strong enough? While this is clearly important, I feel it is secondary to managing behaviour by issuing consequences (and by the way, I DO feel I have fairly strong relationships). Therefore, we\u2019re never going to agree on this one. \n\nI\u2019m honestly at my wits end and Friday\u2019s lesson ended with me being told off yet again for not controlling them well enough and them consequently not getting enough work done. Now, I don\u2019t disagree with either of those assessments, but I feel like my toolbox is completely empty to do anything about that. My view is - why would a kid want to behave if they can get away with absolutely no consequence?\n\nIn addition to this, she will undermine me and fail to follow through - 2 recent examples:\n\nA pupil was using her phone in class. As per school policy, I gave her a warning and asked her to put it away. She did not, so I went back over and asked her to hand it to me. She just laughed and said \u201cno, you\u2019re not getting my phone.\u201d I went to HoD, who essentially said \u201cof course so and so won\u2019t give you her phone, you don\u2019t have that relationship with her. Tell her to put it in her bag as a middle ground.\u201d Of course, she didn\u2019t do that either. = me being undermined and once again lets this pupil know she can do what she likes. \n\nSame pupil - swore at me after I asked her to pick up her rubbish and put it in the bin. I referred this to HoD and she told that she doesn\u2019t want to escalate to SLT immediately as she knows this will result in her being excluded (as she already had been for same behaviour in another department). This was 10 days ago and there\u2019s been no action as far as I am aware. \n\nPupils will refuse to sit in their correct seat and go begging to HoD to let them move. Usually accompanied by a spurious reason. Cue HoD arriving and asking me if so and so can sit elsewhere because they work so well together and can be trusted. Of course this leads to others asking me to move seat. I then end up being the bad guy. \n\nI generally feel she has their back more than mine! And the bottom line is I\u2019m finding it demoralising and anxiety-inducing to be working for someone who I just don\u2019t like. I don\u2019t find her character to be pleasant at all. I feel that she speaks down to me. \n\nI now want to leave this school. I feel like I am making progress with my rowdy class - I can now get them in and quiet during the starter task. I\u2019m using positive behaviour management strategies - stickers, praise postcards, writing the names on the board of those who are following my instructions - which are her suggestions and ethos. However, she\u2019s still not happy. I think she only ever sees the \u2018bad\u2019. I feel my other 3 lessons that day went well and I didn\u2019t have any major behaviour issues there. Of course, she wasn\u2019t present to see any of this because there was no reason to call her through! \n\nI suppose my question is - is it possible to make this environment work? On the one hand, clearly some teachers are able to and have stayed at the school for the long haul. (Although I do get the impression that staff turnover is fairly high.) I\u2019ve seen them command classes well without issuing consequences, but I feel I am too far gone to bring them back to this stage. And of course, I\u2019m well aware that it is exceedingly difficult to bring a class back once you\u2019ve lost them. ",

I love MFL/EAL so I was dead excited to start this job!\n\nI'm particularly with one student who has limited English, doesn't read thier own language well and hasn't really been a stable academic setting before. Now this student is also a bit of disrupter and a class clown (expected as they don't understand the content of lessons). They are also...well lazy...and the idea of doing any work is the end of the world.\n\nThe other day, they asked me an academic question about the solar system. I was so excited that they showed some interest in something educational, so I went home and spent hours preparing something interactive.\n\nThe next day, I got a globe and torch ready, we acted out how an orbit works, some reading material and naming sheets etc. Half way through, they threw themselves on the table and said 'this is so boring!' I guess my pride was a little bit hurt, because I spent ages trying to prepare something that doesn't involve sticking them Infront of a screen (nothing wrong with this, but I'm mindful they already spent a lot of Thier learning time Infront of a screen).\n\nLong story short, is there any tips on how I can create engaging EAL lessons? I totally get that not all lessons are meant to be entertaining...but I really want to support them as I see great potential! Also...I'm only on week 3 at this jobs too ..so I understand that some things will come in time.\n\nThank you so much in advance!",

They are pre-diagnosis but suspected PICA/ASD/GDD. They are non verbal, sensory seeking, stimming a lot. They have input from OT, neuro and speech and language therapy. They are beginning to learn makaton. \n\nMy main concern is that most of the playgroup activities are not appropriate for the child's safety. I've witnessed mouthfuls of sand, glue, paint, washing up liquid in water and today a mouthful of stick on googly eyes. I understand that the framework has to show different play 'stations' that are available to all children. All the other children are fine with the 'hazards' and know the boundaries of play and what you shouldn't put in your mouth. The child I look after doesn't necessarily swallow hazardous items, but seems to seek oral stimulation. I feel quite strongly that we need to adjust the environment for the child with SEN, without limiting the education for the other children. \n\nIf we had oral safe items, then I would be able to use positive behavioural management much more effectively due to the developmental delays this child has. The child cannot communicate effectively, and we really are at the first stage of providing the right support for the child. The child also sensory seeks by biting, pulling hair and sometimes pushing. I believe that if we weren't constantly correcting mouthing behaviours, we could reduce the other behaviours we see in this child and focus on developing learning skills, speech etc. \n\nI've sent an email to my manager with some resources, requesting a team meeting with the parents to discuss the child's educational needs and to develop a consistent approach.\nHas anyone else been in similar situations?

The HOD doesn\u2019t seem to have it in them to stand up to them (or to this other person).\n\nI\u2019m bending myself over backwards trying to help this department make much-needed gains.

The school themselves are being supportive and have admitted they are a class unlike anything else. until now, I have never felt anything but supported. My target has been behaviour management because I was finding this difficult at the start of the year, but I did have a breakdown at the end of the day last week with a very difficult lesson.\n\nI asked for support and followed every single piece of advice - my mentor said this to me unprompted in a meeting today. I have used every PPA to observe other teachers and I am undertaking CPD about behaviour management in my own time.\n\nMy mentor did not seem to fully understand why I was so surprised at the thought of a support plan, and I said it was a formal document that at this point made it likely that I wouldn't pass my ECT 2. I asked if it was entirely formal and she said she would need to research. I asked if it would extend my ECT and she said it was possible but she would need to discuss it with the headteacher.\n\nI am already on the edge with this class - I've had several conversations with other members of staff because I am not coping very well mentally, but this is not impacting my teaching. I have been told by my mentor that I am reflecting and following every piece of feedback I am given and when I asked why I was on track to fail, it was linked to a comment I made during the breakdown last week where I said \"I don't know if any learning happened in that lesson.\"\n\nI might just be being immature or too cocky, but I think this is ridiculous. If you judged every teacher by their worst lesson, surely they'd all be on a support plan. There has been no issues since. I don't see how it's possible to go from glowing reports to on track to fail in one term.\n\nIs it unreasonable to ask for a discussion with the headteacher about this?

(How stupid, I fill out my own payslip!) Not only this, they won't set up a retirement scheme until I am theee months into the job.\n\nThis is crazy to me. In Australia for doing the same job through an agency I was getting WAY more pay, an excellent retirement scheme and never once did the agency ask for a single cent off me.\n\nIs this normal here?",

      "selftext": "Hi all. A student teacher in crisis here.\n\nI posted on this community last week from a mental health day off work, after becoming completely and utterly overwhelmed by anxiety after school last Tuesday.\n\nI am a SCITT student who has had mostly positive feedback in my observations. I work really hard to have great relationships with mt students and staff, the only barrier being myself. On Wednesday, I had to call in sick to work following a sleepless night, nausea and dizziness all due to my anxiety. I have been diagnosed with anxiety, depression, and complicated grief since I lost my mum at 15 (for reference, I am 23 now).\n\nI was in training on Thursday and back to school on Friday, however my mentor has Fridays off so did not see her. I arrived at school this morning to a slightly uncomfortable conversation between myself and my mentor regarding my day off and teachers having to teach lessons they had not planned because of my absence and also that the nature of teaching is that sometimes we have to get on with things with our own baggage. I by no means resent my mentor at all for this conversation, I in fact agree with everything she told me. We have a great relationship and could tell she felt uncomfortable having to have the discussion with me. She also suggested that the Head of Department would need to speak to me about this sickness and the implications of it.\n\nI just feel completely at a loss. Going in this morning was a huge ordeal as it was, I by no means feel well enough to be at work but am so afraid to let my department or mentor down as this is my placement school I will return to after Christmas. I can\u2019t understand what has me feeling so low in confidence, but I just can\u2019t shake it. I feel as though this conversation this morning has completely demotivated me and I don\u2019t know where to go from here. I have come home from work this evening in full hysteria and this is only made worse that I have my first formal observation from my SCITT team this Wednesday.\n\nWhat do I do? I\u2019m so afraid of speaking up about my problems now and so afraid of being thrown off the course. I love the students I work with but I am so overwhelmed with emotion that this cannot be good for my mental health long term. Has/ did anyone else have similar during their training year? Is it time for me to admit teaching is not for me?",

However, having had form groups that I took over in my teacher training, I feel like I have some understanding of how form groups need to be a positive environment where students see a teacher who knows them better than anyone. I\u2019ve never really achieved that with this class.\n\nI took over this Y11 FG from my HoD as Y10s last year, when my HoD took on greater responsibilities. When I first had my FG, they seemed resentful that I wasn\u2019t their original FG tutor who they had had since Y7. Since then, our relationship has only worsened and it\u2019s like the students are becoming more immature over time. The students are defiant, noisy and disrespectful, refuse to ever stop talking basically, and PSHE is a nightmare. I dread work every day ONLY because of my form group. It\u2019s been moved to the end of the teaching day, so essentially every day is capped by half an hour of behaviour management whilst failing to deliver some content.\n\nIf anyone has any wisdom to impart please do!!!

      "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nMy school is introducing a new policy where teaching is to take place during tutor time for years 10 and 11. I'm curious about how this approach has worked for others (if others have done it all). From what I understand, the decision was based on improvements seen in some other schools in our school group, but I can't help but wonder if those results were influenced by cohort-specific factors rather than the teaching method itself.\n\nI'm also concerned about the opportunity cost in terms of pastoral care. I worry that switching the focus to academic content during this time could mean students lose that vital support. Has anyone seen this happen, or perhaps seen it managed well in a way that keeps the balance?\n\nI\u2019d really appreciate hearing your thoughts or experiences if your school has adopted a similar model.\n\n - Is it acceptable in the unions\u2019 eyes?\n\n- Did it work well?\n\n- Do you, like I will, miss your old pastoral role as a tutor (I will never be one again at this school)?\n\n- Were there unintended consequences?\n\nWe as a staff were not consulted about this by the way. We were told it was happening and very soon. Any ideas how / whether to challenge this would be appreciated.\u00a0\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n",

      "selftext": "So I\u2019m an ECT Year 2 teaching history at an MAT school in London. Recently, our department got reviewed by our network lead. He had some positives, but he also said that the way we do lessons needs to change. At the moment we have this lesson structure:\n1. five question do now\n2. showing students an image and getting them to make inferences for it \n3. Initial teacher exposition to give them a sense of what we\u2019re learning about today\n4. Pre-teaching key vocabulary\n5. Five to minutes reading to give students the key content on a single A4 sheet\n6. Checking for understanding using mono whiteboards \n7. Independent practice - written comprehension, filling in tables, flowcharts, timelines and mindmaps\n8. Practice exam paragraph\n\nOur network lead has told us that our lessons need to have much longer reading, ideally 2 - 3 A4 pages in the trust booklet. He also says that the reading, as it is in the trust booklet, should take a more narrative format with lots of description of how everything looked, historical figures being slowly introduced like characters in a novel and a sense of suspense as the historical drama is shown as slowly unfolding like in a novel. He argues that this is vital for getting students more interested in history and giving them a sense of what the period was like. I felt sceptical of this after we were told this as I believe strongly in independent practice and students engaging with historical concepts and doing hard thinking g should get most lesson time. I\u2019m also weary of the implications of cognitive load. But am I just being unnecessarily sceptical and as is the approach that me and my department currently do in fact wrong and outmoded? \n\n",

However the response I got was \u201cthere isn\u2019t anything more we can do. We can\u2019t lower their predictions and we can\u2019t remove them from the course.\u201d \n\nThis has absolutely baffled me as surely they can do these things?

I don't do it every lesson, but I do try to get some focused independent work in as much as possible, even with my bottom sets, because I want every individual challenged. I generally present the task, model a bit, check they've got it, tell them I want it quiet as a library and pop a timer on the board.\n\nExperienced teachers in my faculty are very approving and say it's a sign I'm coming along and can now get the best quality work out of my kids, but it's actually giving me a new kind of insecurity. I just feel like I'm slacking off as a teacher. Maybe it's just the imposter syndrome of being a trainee, but I feel like if I'm not constantly questioning, getting an interested discussion going, building relationships and writing on the boards, I must be slacking off or missing something teachers are meant to do.\n\nI stand there, checking who's working, monitoring and enforcing the atmosphere, and if someone obviously doesn't know what they're doing I'll go whisper with them (and if they're clearly lost I'll abort and model more), but I feel so vulnerable and awkward. \n\nIt's worst with some brilliant year 10s I share with my HoD. Talking to them at the best of times is like getting water out of a stone, but when KS4 is just sat working, what am I supposed to be doing except watching and checking they're on task?\n\nMaybe it's because almost all my classes have been noisy KS3 ones, I'm just not used to this kind of vibe.\n\nAnyone ever felt like this?",

I get told to fuck off. Again. And again, and again. Nope. \n\nI saw a random staff member and asked her to get the head as I\u2019m going home. The kid was at the other end of the hall, so didn\u2019t hear and the deputy spoke to me. I told him what happened. I said \u2018if you\u2019re happy for your staff to be treated like that, whatever but I\u2019m not so I\u2019m going.\u2019 They said ok, and I went. \n\nThen I cried in the car lol.\n\nI\u2019m getting out of teaching. Behaviour is wild. You shouldn\u2019t feel unsafe, ever.  \n\nAlso, if you have a supply TA for a VERY challenging child, please give them a rough idea of what to expect! Don\u2019t just assume they\u2019ll figure it out and be ok. ",

I have a year 8 form and have been really suffering with the attitude from a group of girls in my form for the past few months. This has been reported and have been following the behaviour policy without fail. Today in form one of the girls put her hand up and said something really mean and personal to me. I was so shocked that I asked all students to remain in silence for the rest of the form and then my emotions got the better of me and I cried ( silently but the class clearly noticed). \n\nThe group of girls were giggling.  The incident is being dealt with but I am just looking for advice to ease my embarrassment slightly- absolutely mortified that the children saw me clearly upset. I have been teaching a long time and have never cried in front of a class before so don't know what came over me this morning!\n\nEdit: Posted this because I was feeling upset and exhausted and felt the need for a bit of support! Most of the comments have been so kind and helpful. Read them all and appreciate all of your kind words. My emotions today happened to get the better of me. I will be discussing the impact that words have with my form tomorrow. The girls in question have been removed from my form.  Despite the comments suggesting it was my fault, I have always done everything to the best of my ability and I know that I am a strong teacher that cried because I care. This is not the result of poor behaviour management but a bad morning mixed with nasty comments.\n\n Normally I would delete posts like this out of embarrassment however I know another teacher will come on here looking for the support I needed today and will also appreciate the kind words from colleagues on Reddit.",

Mum picked her up and she was back in school not 15 minutes later, the burn mark miraculously gone. The whole time it was lipstick.

      "title": "The obsession with attendance. ",
      "selftext": "Hello, primary school teacher here. Relatively experienced across a few different countries. Currently reside in south England. \n\nI'm seeing and hearing lots of focus on attendance.\nMy current school celebrate attendance each week in assembly. \n'cracking down' on attendance issues seems to be a political strategy. \n\nI don't understand. \n\nWhat exactly is the issue with children not being in school? \n\nI understand in terms of safeguarding, we need to keep an eye on children's welfare, and there are, sadly, some parents who don't / won't/ can't look after their children. But that doesn't change just because they've come to school. \n\nThe arguments I hear include those children getting an education and a hot meal. But this is rather undermined by the fact that most classrooms are stretched far too thin to adequately engage every child, and lunch hall staff have enough to do without checking children are eating enough; the amount of food wasted because children don't want to waste precious playtime sitting inside eating is alarming (I have conducted pupil voice surveys during lunchtime at every school I've worked in). \n\nI frequently hear academy administrators emphasising the 'learning time lost' if a child is late to school each day. Yet learning time is lost every single lesson of every single day for almost every single child due to large class sizes, limited resources, dodgy technology and a packed, over-ambitious curriculum. \n\nThe benefit of a day off of school, however, in many cases seems to be entirely justified. \n\nA child in my class told me he was going on holiday on Friday, they were going camping in Wales for the weekend. He was so excited as he'd never been camping before. I know his parents work shifts and they are rarely both around at the same time. He's the sort of child who spends his school holidays being shipped around family and friends whilst his parents work. Our system didn't have an authorised absence logged. On the Friday, the register said his mum had called in and said he was unwell. I said nothing. I feel justified in that decision. \n\nI can tell you exactly what he missed: a single PE lesson practising the same sports they do every year for sports day, an art lesson on shading using colour run by a TA during my PPA, sorting shapes in maths, free writing a story whilst I dealt with the most needy child in my class who needed 40 minutes of adult intervention to regulate and an assembly read out from Twinkl. The only direct instruction from a qualified teacher he would have received was 10 minutes at the beginning of maths and of course he missed the allocated 15 minutes of being read to by a 'professional'. \n\nTaking time out for a holiday is by far justifiable by most teachers I meet. But what of the children who simply need more rest? Those who are over stimulated by the classroom environment? The neuro divergent children whose brains struggle with lots of short lessons? What exactly are those children missing out on if they take a day off every now and then? \n\nThe idea that children only learn in school, baffles me. My entire class this year had to learn a science unit that was last taught in a year that they mostly missed due to COVID. Serious discussions took place across my planning meeting over how I would need to scale it back to meet the gap. They needn't have bothered. The only observable gap was in understanding some terminology. \n\nOur Ks1 classes are fraught with low social skills, difficult behaviour and developmental disorders. The children who didn't get institutionalised from the age of 2 because the whole thing shut down and many of our parents lost their jobs and inevitably ended up at home for the last couple of years, have quite understandably responded badly to being put into a classroom environment. \n\nSocial care isn't there. Support services have dropped away. Workload is horrendous. The curriculum is so packed we never fit anything in. Chances to make connections to the real world of a child are limited (how on earth I was expected to teach the slave trade to 9 year olds who have never left the edge of town). \n\nThe only enforcement of attendance that I can see, is to ensure children have optimum chance to learn to 'school'. \n\nPerhaps in my teetering middle age, I am starting to wonder if forcing children to 'school' under the pretense of giving them an education, is really the way forward.

      "selftext": "Hi all, I have noticed recently especially in the last few years partly due to the pandemic that there has been a rise in 'Little emperors' and 'empresses' in the classroom. Those of you who aren't familiar with the term, 'Little emperor syndrome' stemmed from the 1 child policy in China due to the excess amount of attention they received from their parents and to a lesser extent grandparents, typically an only child (or a child a lot younger than the rest of their siblings) with demanding behavior due to overindulgent parenting. \n\nWe have mentioned a lot of absent parents in teaching but haven't really shone a light on the opposite. I am moving to a more affluent school in a nicer part of the city come September in a school with behavioural difficulties who do fit the stereotype of being 'Little emperors'. Children who will openly shrug their shoulders and say that 'they don't care' if you're calling home for behaviour. Children who can do no wrong in their parent's eyes, and it's not their fault that they're misbehaving it's Tim's or Beth's!\n\nThey are truly some of the most difficult children to get through to in my opinion because bad behaviour is typically rewarded at home because they are spoilt and have their parents wrapped around their fingers. Children of absent parents can be winnable through relationship building as they may not have a similar relationship at home. Little emperors on the other hands are little terrors who are just spoilt little..",

      "selftext": "I'm a first year Teach First trainee. Year 9 period 5 today just weren't having it. The class has one or two high profile students, but in general they just weren't interested in listening to me. Establishing silence for longer than a few seconds so I could speak without being talked over was impossible. I take it most teachers have had classes like that.\n\nAnyway, nothing I was doing to establish calm was working, so I followed the policy (which I should have earlier) and sent two students out.\n\nThe behaviour lead popped in for a minute randomly. I think he was just walking around showing the flag, so to speak. And then 5 minutes later so did the head. They both gave support that really helped feel more in control of the class, but then the head sent back in the two students I removed.\n\nI think he was giving a tour to an outside visitor who was looking into the school's behaviour system, and was trying to impress that person by de-escalating the situation, but I didn't get offered a choice and felt extremely shaken and undermined. What was I supposed to do with these students now, if they continue to act up (as they did)? I already removed them and they just came back.\n\nThat shook me, but what made me cry was when the head (giving me some genuinely positive support) intervened again to take a third kid outside, who's normally good but was getting worked up in the situation. This kid starts crying on his way out, and then the girls at the back laugh at him.\n\nAnd while I'm telling them off for being so disgustingly cruel, I start crying too.\n\nI think seeing it shocked the class into ashamed quiet for the rest of the lesson, and I kept the troublemakers back for 5 minutes at the end. None of them objected. The atmosphere changed then. A few of them were genuinely very sorry and I don't think I'm holding any grudges.\n\nThe whole experience was just extremely nerve-wrecking and damaged my confidence. Do classes sometimes just come in in that kind of mood? What are you supposed to do in that situation? Did I overreact to how SLT intervened?\n\nMy mentor is on my side, and says no trainee or ECT should have to have a student they removed back in the same lesson",

      "selftext": "I've just started as a teacher and my TA is giving me a massive headache already. She has been assigned to me because she is apparently the best at dealing with new teachers, and I really don't want to rock the boat in the first few days,, but she is STRESSING ME OUT. The class I have are a class she used to teach before she became a TA so she knows them well, which she keeps using to her advantage as they listen to her instead of me. She is CONSTANTLY trying to take over anything I'm teaching, frequently talking over me and interrupting when I am trying to teach. This morning I couldn't even do the starter activity with my class properly because she told them to begin completing it before i'd even had a chance to explain the task.\n\nMy TA also did the seating chart behind my back without discussing it with me, despite me saying we would sort it together, and has seated some of the more poorly behaved pupils all on the same table at the back?! I have sorted this but it feels like she WANTED me to fail with that arrangement? Moreover, she keeps undermining anything I say. I saved 20 minutes at the end of class to play some games with the children and she completely took over and started telling them about something entirely unrelated that could have waited until next week, cutting me off if I tried to talk and tell her no, we were supposed to be playing games. How do I get her to stop acting like they are her class without causing a drama at my new job? I have tried having a discussion with her already but she walked off in the middle of it \"to get pencils\" and never came back. Everyone else seems to love her and I don't want to seem like I am causing drama, especially being new to the job and the school.HELP!\n\nTLDR: I'm a new teacher and TA keeps trying to take over",

I\u2019ve been at this school a few times- maybe 6/7- and today I was scheduled for a year 10 PE class. Fine, I\u2019ve done that before. \n\nProblem arises because this school has a member of staff inside the changing room with the girls at all times, and I don\u2019t feel comfortable with that. When I was a full time teacher, I did primary and we always had two adults with the kids that were changing, and in every other secondary I\u2019ve done PE in they\u2019ve had the teacher wait outside and only go in if necessary. \n\n\nI know there\u2019s nothing wrong with a member of staff being actually in the room since we\u2019re all DBS checked, but I\u2019ve heard so many stories about allegations that I just didn\u2019t feel comfortable. If I knew the kids better, or if they knew me, maybe I\u2019d be okay with that. But I\u2019m a stranger to them. \n\n\n\nI told one PE teacher I didn\u2019t want to go in and she said it\u2019s fine, just wait right outside. So, I went in whilst they were dressed and did the register, then stood outside the changing room. \n\n\nAnother member of staff asked why I wasn\u2019t in the room, and I just said I wasn\u2019t comfortable with that. \nShe said \u2018but that\u2019s how we do it here\u2019 and I said I\u2019m aware, but I already spoke to Ms X and would rather protect myself. \nShe then said \u2018but what if they have a fight?\u2019 I pointed out that I\u2019m right outside and can hear all their conversations, I can go in at a second\u2019s notice. She huffed and called me unprofessional, said I was overreacting, tried to tell me I HAD to go in, then stormed past me into the changing room (with her phone in her hand may I add) to watch them herself. \n\n\nFine by me. When she came out she gave me the evil eye and said we\u2019d have words later. Okay lady, I\u2019m literally supply with 8 other schools I have great relationships with, I don\u2019t even need to be here but you pop off. \n\n\nI am wondering if I was overreacting though. The whole thing left a sour taste in my mouth and I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m in the wrong. Thoughts?",
