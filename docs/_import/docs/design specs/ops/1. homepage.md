# Sales Page Design Brief for Developers

Create a visually appealing and user-centric sales page that introduces the platform, showcases its value proposition, and guides users toward taking action. The page should be mobile-first, modern, and designed for vertical scrolling. It must reflect the tone, messaging, and style outlined in the `docs/CUSTOMER PROPOSITION.md` and `docs/BRAND_GUIDELINES.md` documents.

## Page Structure

1. Hero Section (Top Fold)
2. Value Proposition Section
3. Features Section
4. Statistics & Testimonials Section
5. Call to Action (CTA) Section

## **Visual Design Guidelines**

- **Imagery:** Blend of abstract graphics (to convey technology) and real-world visuals (e.g., dashboard screenshots).
- **Animations:** Subtle fade-ins, slide-ups, or bounce effects triggered on scroll.
