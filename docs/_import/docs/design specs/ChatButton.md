# **Specification Document: Chat Button Overlay Feature**

## **Overview**

This document specifies the requirements for implementing a chat button overlay, inspired by the behaviour of tools like Intercom. The feature includes a fixed-position chat button, an expandable contact dialog, idle prompts, and smooth animations to enhance user interaction.

---

## **Functional Requirements**

The button emulates the behaviour of tools like Intercom _BUT_ it is not a chat widget. When clicked it behaves as if the chat agent is offline and the user is prompted to enter a message.

The Button has 3 states:

- **Closed**
- **Open**
- **Idle**

---

### **1. Closed: Chat Button**

- **Positioning:**
  - Fixed at the bottom-right corner of the viewport, always visible.
- **Appearance:**
  - Circular button with an icon (e.g., a speech bubble).
  - Configurable styles, such as size, colour, and hover effects, to align with the brand.
- **Hover State:**
  - Highlights subtly with a shadow, opacity change, or colour shift to indicate interactivity.
- **Click Behaviour:**
  - Expands into a small dialog box positioned above or next to the button.
  - Changes the button's icon to a "minimise" symbol while the dialog is open.

---

### **2. Open: Contact Dialog**

- **Positioning:**

  - Anchored to the chat button, appearing above or beside it.
  - For mobile devices, the dialog adjusts to a larger portion of the screen for usability.

- **Appearance:**

  - Compact and clean design, including the following elements:
    - **Header:**
      - Branding or welcome message (e.g., "Simora").
      - Optional avatars or representative images of the support team.
      - A minimise or expand button in the top-right corner.
    - **Body:**
      - A configurable welcome message (e.g., "Hi ðŸ‘‹ How can I help you?").
      - A list of quick reply options (e.g., "Chat with a product expert", "Learn more about us").
    - **Input Area:**
      - If enabled, allows the user to type custom messages.

- **Behaviour:**

  - Smooth open/close animation with a slide and fade transition.
  - Supports dynamic updates to messages and quick reply buttons.

- **Close Options:**

  - Clicking the minimise button.
  - Clicking outside the dialog area.
  - For mobile devices, a swipe-down gesture may optionally minimise the dialog.

- **Responsive Design:**

  - On smaller screens, the dialog resizes or occupies a more significant portion of the screen.
  - Touch-friendly buttons and input areas for usability on mobile devices.

---

### **3. Idle Prompts**

- **Triggering:**

  - Idle state is NOT triggered when button is open
  - Idle state is NOT triggered if the user has interacted with the button at any point.
  - Appears after a defined period of user inactivity (e.g., 10 seconds).
  - Inactivity is measured by the absence of mouse movement, keyboard input, or touch interactions.
  - Once shown, stays visible until explicitly dismissed

- **Appearance:**

  - Fixed width of 340px with 10px outer padding
  - The idle prompt resembles a small pop-out dialog box with the following elements:
    - **Message Content:**
      - A friendly, conversational prompt such as "Hi ðŸ‘‹ How can I help you?".
      - Optionally includes an avatar or logo for branding purposes.
      - Timestamp or context marker (e.g., "Message from Simora Â· 1m ago").
      - Message spans full width of container
    - **Action Buttons:**
      - Stacked vertically below the message
      - Each button is a proper link wrapping a button element
      - Pill-shaped with rounded ends
      - Equal horizontal and vertical padding
      - Light shadow effect
      - Right-aligned to the container
      - Auto-sized to content
      - Hover state indicates clickability
      - Can be configured as quick replies or regular actions
      - Uses Next.js Link components for proper routing

- **Hover Controls:**

  - On hover, shows "View More" and close "X" buttons
  - View More opens the chat dialog directly
  - Close button dismisses the entire message stack
  - Controls fade in/out smoothly

- **Dismissal:**
  - Only through explicit user interaction:
    - Clicking X button
    - Clicking View More (opens chat)
    - Clicking an action link
    - Clicking the chat button
  - General user activity no longer auto-dismisses
  - Reset the last activity time when the dialog is closed

---

## **Detailed Behaviour**

### **Chat Button**

- **Default State:**

  - Circular button positioned at the bottom-right corner of the viewport.
  - Fixed width of 340px container with 10px padding

- **Hover:**

  - Highlights subtly with visual feedback (e.g., shadow or colour change).

- **Click:**
  - Transitions smoothly to open the contact dialog.
  - Changes the button icon to a "minimise" symbol.
  - When clicked again, closes the dialog with a smooth animation.

---

### **Contact Dialog**

- **Animation:**

  - Slides and fades in/out when opening or closing.
  - Transitions should be smooth and subtle, lasting no more than 300ms.

- **Interactivity:**

  - Displays a configurable welcome message and optional quick reply buttons.
  - Allows the user to type messages in an input field (if enabled).
  - Fixed width of 340px with 10px outer padding

- **Action Buttons:**

  - Configurable array of action links
  - Each action has text and href properties
  - Uses Next.js Link components for proper routing
  - Pill-shaped with rounded ends
  - Equal horizontal and vertical padding (px-4 py-2)
  - Light shadow effect
  - Right-aligned for cleaner appearance
  - Auto-sized to prevent text wrapping
  - Hover state indicates clickability

- **Close Options:**
  - Minimise button inside the dialog.
  - Clicking outside the dialog area.

---

### **Idle Prompts**

- **Initial Trigger:**

  - Appear after a defined period of user inactivity (e.g., 10 seconds).

- **Appearance:**

  - A small prompt styled as a speech bubble or tooltip.
  - Positioned near the chat button to subtly draw attention.

- **Dismissal:**

  - Fades out when the user interacts with the button or dialog.
  - Automatically disappears after a short period if there is no interaction.
