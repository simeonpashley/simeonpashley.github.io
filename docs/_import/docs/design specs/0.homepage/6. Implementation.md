# **Simora Homepage — Revised Implementation Plan (Next.js 14 + Tailwind)**

## 1. Overview

You have a **fully operational stack** running on **Next.js 14** with **Static Site Generation** and **Tailwind CSS**. The new homepage (and any sub-brand pages) will be **iterated** on top of this existing foundation, ensuring minimal disruption and faster turnaround.

---

## 2. Project Phases & Deliverables

### **Phase 1: High-Fidelity Design**

**Objective**
- Translate approved wireframes, moodboard, and content outlines into polished, final designs.

**Key Changes**
- Since the underlying tech stack is set, designers can reference existing **Tailwind utility classes** or design tokens (if any are documented).

**Tasks**
1. **Refine Visual Elements**
   - Apply brand colors, typography, and imagery consistently, aligned with our Tailwind utility approach.
   - Confirm reusable UI patterns (e.g., button variants, sub-brand highlights).
2. **Update Copy & Layout**
   - Finalize text in Figma (or your design tool), ensuring placeholders are replaced with real copy.
3. **Accessibility Checks**
   - Verify color contrast with Tailwind’s built-in classes (e.g., `bg-`, `text-`, etc.).
4. **Design System Alignment**
   - If you have a shared design system in Figma or Storybook, ensure new components follow that structure.

**Deliverables**
- **High-Fidelity Mockups** (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- **Annotated Design Files** (if needed for dev alignment).

**Estimated Timeline**: ~1 week (assuming minimal feedback loops).

### **Phase 2: Prototype & Stakeholder Review**

**Objective**
- Create a clickable prototype to validate flows, interactivity, and visual consistency before coding.

**Tasks**
1. **Link Mockups** in Figma/Sketch/XD
   - Add clickable hotspots for navigation, sub-brand CTAs, etc.
2. **Hover & Focus States**
   - Demonstrate expected interactions (button hover, focus outlines).
3. **Gather Feedback**
   - Team/stakeholders provide final input to avoid rework later.

**Deliverables**
- **Interactive Prototype** (shared link).
- **Feedback Summary**.

**Estimated Timeline**: ~1 week.

### **Phase 3: Front-End Integration (Next.js 14 + Tailwind)**

**Objective**
- Implement the approved homepage design into the existing Next.js 14 + Tailwind codebase using your current SSG approach.

**Tasks**
1. **Create/Update Page Component**
   - Define a new `homepage.tsx` or adapt `index.tsx` (if that’s your entry point).
   - Leverage **Tailwind** utility classes for layout, typography, spacing.
2. **Modular Components**
   - Build reusable components for the Hero, Sub-brand highlights, Testimonials, etc.
   - Integrate them into your site’s existing component structure (and existing design system if applicable).
3. **Integration with SSG**
   - If the homepage uses dynamic data (e.g., pulling featured testimonials from a CMS), ensure `getStaticProps` (or `getServerSideProps` if needed) is properly configured.
4. **Accessibility & Responsiveness**
   - Validate color contrast, alt texts, keyboard navigation.
   - Confirm responsiveness with Tailwind’s breakpoints (`sm:`, `md:`, etc.).
5. **Staging / Preview Deployment**
   - Publish to a staging environment or preview URL for QA.

**Deliverables**
- **Functional Homepage** in Next.js.
- **Staging Link** for QA.

**Estimated Timeline**: ~1–2 weeks (depending on the complexity of new components & feedback).

### **Phase 4: QA & User Testing**

**Objective**
- Ensure the new homepage aligns with design specs, performs well, and meets accessibility standards.

**Tasks**
1. **Cross-Browser & Device Testing**
   - Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, plus mobile browsers.
2. **Accessibility Audit**
   - Use Lighthouse or axe to check for WCAG compliance (focus states, semantic structure, alt text).
3. **Performance Checks**
   - Since you’re using SSG, confirm quick page loads. Check metrics like LCP, TTI.
   - Optimize images (Tailwind + Next.js have built-in image components).
4. **Content Validation**
   - Double-check copy for typos or layout quirks.
5. **Stakeholder Sign-Off**
   - Final thumbs-up from leadership and marketing teams.

**Deliverables**
- **QA/Accessibility Report** with pass/fail items.
- **Signed-Off Homepage** ready for production.

**Estimated Timeline**: ~1 week.

### **Phase 5: Launch & Post-Launch**

**Objective**
- Merge final code into your **main branch**, then deploy to production.

**Tasks**
1. **Production Deployment**
   - Merge & deploy (e.g., via Vercel, Netlify, or your chosen hosting).
   - Confirm production environment matches staging.
2. **Analytics Verification**
   - Ensure page views, CTA clicks, and custom events are tracking properly.
3. **Post-Launch Monitoring**
   - Monitor for errors, user feedback, or performance issues.
4. **Documentation**
   - Provide any new component references or usage notes for the dev/design team.

**Deliverables**
- **Live Homepage** on your domain.
- **Documentation** (component usage, update instructions).

**Estimated Timeline**: ~1 week (plus ongoing monitoring).

## 4. Roles & Responsibilities

- **Product Owner / PM**: Coordinates timeline, feedback, and approvals.
- **UI/UX Designer**: Preps final Figma mockups and interactive prototypes.
- **Front-End Dev**: Implements homepage in Next.js + Tailwind, ensuring SSG and performance.
- **QA Specialist**: Conducts cross-browser, accessibility, and performance tests.
- **Marketing/Content Team**: Delivers final copy, verifies brand tone, and checks lead-gen workflows.

---

## 5. Risk & Mitigation

1. **Design/Dev Alignment**
   - Mitigate by building a shared component library or referencing existing Tailwind patterns.
2. **Content Delays**
   - Have fallback placeholder text that devs can insert if final copy is late.
3. **Scope Changes**
   - If new sub-pages or functionality are added mid-process, factor that into a separate mini-project or subsequent phase.
4. **Migration Concerns**
   - If the old homepage is heavily SEO-optimized, preserve key metadata (title, meta desc, structured data) to maintain search rankings.

---

## 6. Sign-Off & Execution

Once this **Revised Implementation Plan** is agreed upon, the team will:

1. Kick off **High-Fidelity Design** updates.
2. Proceed through each phase, ensuring tight collaboration between design and dev.
3. Deliver a **new Simora homepage** that’s visually compelling, performance-oriented, and aligned with your existing Next.js + Tailwind stack.

**End of Plan**
