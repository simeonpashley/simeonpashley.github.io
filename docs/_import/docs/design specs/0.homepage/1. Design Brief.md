# **Simora Homepage Design Brief**

## 1. Project Background

Simora unifies three core offerings—**Evolve**, **Build**, and **Ops**—under one umbrella. These sub-brands provide:

- **Evolve**: Strategic consultancy and fractional CTO support
- **Build**: Full-stack development and enterprise architecture
- **Ops**: A powerful e-commerce operations platform

### Why This Matters

- **Simplicity**: Clients see Simora as a single, trusted brand.
- **Expertise**: Demonstrates 35+ years of experience in eCommerce, AI, and enterprise solutions.
- **Scalability**: Positioned to grow with clients, from strategic planning to operational excellence.

With a proven track record guiding global organizations, Simora leverages AI-driven strategies and deep technical leadership—though client confidentiality may limit the immediate inclusion of explicit metrics or detailed case studies.

## 2. Project Objectives & Goals

1. **Primary Goal: Lead Generation**

   - Use the homepage to capture leads (e.g., “Schedule a Consultation,” “Get in Touch”).
   - Short term: Circulate the site among your network to drive inquiries.

2. **Secondary Goal: Brand Awareness**

   - Position Simora as a forward-thinking partner that excels in AI-driven eCommerce and technology solutions.
   - Reinforce the brand’s longevity, expertise, and future-readiness in the digital & AI space.

3. **Introduce the Umbrella Brand**

   - Clarify how Evolve, Build, and Ops fit together under Simora’s ecosystem.
   - Present a cohesive identity aligned with brand guidelines and an “Empowering & Approachable” voice.

4. **Highlight Value Propositions**

   - Demonstrate how consultancy, development, and e-commerce operations interconnect.
   - Convey trust, innovation, and measurable results (even if specific client metrics remain confidential for now).

5. **Convey Professionalism & Credibility**
   - Eventually integrate approved client stories or quotes once clearance is obtained.
   - Emphasize AI as a key differentiator—businesses are looking to show AI progress and need a trusted partner.

## 3. Target Audience

- **SMEs & Entrepreneurs**

  - Seeking cost-effective, scalable solutions without heavy technical overhead.

- **E-commerce Retailers**

  - Desiring multi-channel integration, operational efficiency, and AI-driven growth.

- **Mid to Large Enterprises**
  - Needing fractional CTO expertise, enterprise-level architecture, and cutting-edge AI and automation strategies.

**Tone**: Unifying, “one-size-fits-most.” We’ll maintain a general homepage message appealing to both SMEs and enterprise clients. If needed, deeper sub-pages can fine-tune language for each segment.

## 4. Key Messaging

- **One Umbrella, Many Solutions**
  Simora helps businesses evolve strategically (Evolve), build robust tech (Build), and streamline e-commerce ops (Ops).

- **Results-Focused**
  Measurable outcomes (improved revenue, efficiency, scalability), kept general until specific client data is approved.

- **Future-Proof & AI-Driven**
  AI, automation, and MACH architectures as primary differentiators for businesses aiming to stay competitive.

- **Empowering & Approachable**
  A partner in the journey, speaking with clarity rather than heavy technical jargon.

## 5. Deliverables for This Phase

1. **Site Map & Information Architecture**

   - High-level structure to show how the homepage guides users to each sub-brand.

2. **Content Outline (Skeleton Copy)**

   - Draft or placeholder text for the homepage’s hero, features, CTAs, and testimonials.

3. **Low-Fidelity Wireframes**

   - Basic sketches illustrating the layout, focusing on lead capture points and brand messaging.

4. **Moodboard / Visual Direction**

   - Color palette, typography samples (aligned with Simora’s guidelines), and imagery style references.

5. **Accessibility & Technical Considerations**

   - Initial guidelines to ensure inclusive design and smooth integration with the existing **Next.js 14 + Tailwind** stack.

6. **User Personas**
   - Create a small set of persona archetypes (e.g., SME owners, enterprise tech leads) based on the proposition.
   - You can refine these personas over time to ensure messaging resonates.

_(Note: If clearance for specific client success metrics or stories is granted mid-project, we can integrate them into the final copy.)_

## 6. Assumptions & Constraints

- **Brand Guidelines Are Final**
  - Colors, typography (Inter, etc.), and logo usage are established.
- **Unified Tone**
  - The homepage focuses on a single, approachable voice, appealing broadly to both SME and enterprise visitors.
- **Timeline**
  - Initial design sign-off targeted within 2–3 weeks, flexible as you’re the only stakeholder.
- **Content Availability**
  - Real metrics or client stories may be added later upon client clearance.
  - Placeholder copy can be used if final content is delayed.
- **Resources & Existing Tech**
  - A Next.js 14 + Tailwind CSS stack is already in place, along with a foundational component library.
  - No specialized compliance or legal constraints beyond standard e-commerce best practices.

## 7. Success Criteria

1. **Lead Generation**

   - Primary KPI: Inquiries or consultation requests from the homepage.
   - Secondary: Growing brand awareness through direct site visits and word-of-mouth referrals.

2. **Stakeholder Satisfaction**

   - As the sole stakeholder, your sign-off confirms the homepage meets strategic, aesthetic, and functional needs.

3. **Cohesion & Clarity**

   - The homepage effectively conveys Simora’s brand story, core AI differentiators, and easy next steps for potential clients.

4. **Scalability**
   - Architecture and design that can accommodate expanded sub-brand pages, new client testimonials, or additional AI solutions without a full redesign.

### **Sign-Off**

By approving this revised Design Brief, we align on the focus (lead generation + brand awareness), the unified tone for all audiences, the strong AI emphasis, and the deliverables. We’ll then proceed with:

1. **Site Map & IA**
2. **Content Outline**
3. **Wireframes**
4. **Moodboard**
5. **Accessibility & Technical**
6. **Initial User Personas**

All in service of crafting a homepage that showcases Simora’s unique blend of **consultancy, development,** and **AI-driven ops**—driving leads and bolstering brand recognition.
