# **Simora Homepage — Moodboard & Visual Direction**

This document outlines the **look and feel** we’ll target for the Simora homepage, providing a visual reference that ensures consistency with existing **Simora Brand Guidelines**. We’re focusing on color usage, typography styles, and imagery approach before we move into high-fidelity designs.

## 1. Color Palette & Usage

### **Primary Brand Colors**
- **Simora Blue** (#1F4B99)
  - Ideal for headers, main backgrounds, or prominent CTA gradients.
- **Evolve Green** (#28A745)
  - Represents strategic consultancy; great as accent or highlight in Evolve sections.
- **Build Orange** (#FF8C42)
  - Conveys energy for development features; used in Build highlights.
- **Ops Grey** (#6C757D)
  - Symbolizes operational stability; perfect for Ops-based callouts or backgrounds.

### **Secondary / Neutral Tones**
- **Neutral White** (#FFFFFF)
  - Background for content sections, ensuring readability and clarity.
- **Light Grey** (e.g., #F8F9FA)
  - Subtle background blocks, separating sections without visual clutter.

**Usage Notes**
- Utilize **Simora Blue** as the main brand anchor (hero backgrounds, key CTAs).
- Incorporate **sub-brand colors** to differentiate Evolve, Build, Ops in dedicated sections or accent strips.
- Apply **neutral hues** for large content areas, balancing bold sub-brand color blocks.

## 2. Typography

### **Primary Typeface: “Inter”**
- **Headings**: Bold, modern styling at larger sizes (H1 ~48px, H2 ~36px).
  - Use Simora Blue or sub-brand color for emphasis.
- **Body Text**: Regular or light weight at 16px for easy reading.
  - High-contrast, typically dark grey (#333 or #222) on light backgrounds.

### **Hierarchy & Emphasis**
1. **H1/H2**: Clear, bold statements—empowering and approachable.
2. **H3/H4/Subheadings**: Slightly smaller, semi-bold.
3. **Body**: Clean, readable paragraphs with comfortable line spacing (~1.5).
4. **Callouts / Highlights**: Sub-brand color or bold text for key benefits, stats, or quotes.

## 3. Imagery & Iconography

### **Imagery Style**
- **Clean, Minimalist Illustrations**:
  - Abstract shapes or subtle gradients to symbolize growth, innovation, AI-driven processes.
- **People & Collaboration**:
  - Images depicting teams strategizing or developers building solutions, aligning with the Tone of Voice (approachable, supportive).
- **Screenshots / Mockups**:
  - For Build or Ops, show partial UI mockups or dashboards to hint at product functionality without overwhelming detail.

### **Iconography**
- **Line-Based, Modern Icons**:
  - Consistent stroke weight, minimal detail.
  - Each sub-brand can have a thematic icon set (e.g., gear for Build, charts for Ops, compass or roadmap for Evolve).
- **Color Accents**:
  - Outline icons in dark grey or white; fill with sub-brand colors where emphasis is needed.

---

## 4. Layout & Spacing

### **Sections & White Space**
- Adopt a **12-column grid** with generous padding (40px desktop, 20px mobile).
- Large hero with plenty of breathing room to feature the main headline and CTA.
- **Modular sections** below, each focusing on a single message or topic (value props, sub-brand highlights, testimonials).

### **Stripe/Intercom-Inspired Simplicity**
- Keep backgrounds simple—solid or light gradient blocks—so text remains front and center.
- Subtle hover animations on buttons and icons for a modern, polished feel.

---

## 5. Motion & Interactivity

- **Subtle Animations**:
  - Fade-in or slide-in on scroll for hero text and section titles.
  - Button hover effects that slightly lift or darken the gradient.
- **No Overly Complex Transitions**:
  - Maintain performance and user focus.
- **Consistent Interaction Patterns**:
  - If a button has a hover shadow, replicate it across all buttons sitewide.

---

## 6. Overall Aesthetic

- **Modern, Professional, Trustworthy**:
  - Leverage strong typography and bold color blocks.
- **Approachable & Empowering**:
  - Imagery should show collaboration, success, and forward motion.
- **Balanced Use of Color**:
  - Keep the site “clean” with neutrals, letting sub-brand accents shine as highlights.

---

## 7. Reference Mock-Ups or Inspiration

1. **Intercom / Stripe**
   - Clean sectional layouts, big headlines, minimal clutter.
   - Fluid animations that guide the user, not distract.
2. **Existing Simora Sub-Brand Materials** (if available)
   - Ensure brand consistency with established color usage or icon styles.
3. **Abstract Gradients**
   - Light diagonal or radial gradients from **Simora Blue** to a sub-brand color can underscore the brand synergy.
