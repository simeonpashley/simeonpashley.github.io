### **Visual Consistency and Branding Tips**

1. **Consistent Use of Assigned Colors:**

   - This consistency fosters strong visual recognition and reinforces the association between each service and its color.

2. **Color Hierarchy and Emphasis:**
   - Use the umbrella brand’s blue as the primary color for overarching branding elements.
   - Highlight sub-brands with their specific colors to differentiate each service while maintaining a cohesive brand identity.

3. **Complementary Design Elements:**
   - Pair each sub-brand color with complementary tones to enhance visual appeal and readability.
   - For instance, use neutral backgrounds with vibrant sub-brand colors to make key elements stand out.

   - Leverage the psychological impact of each color to reinforce the sub-brand’s message. For example:
     - **Orange** for "Renew" conveys urgency and energy.
     - **Blue** for "Maintain" and "Assess" instills trust and reliability.
     - **Green** for "Evolve" symbolizes growth and innovation.
     - **Red** for "Ignite" emphasizes urgency and the importance of action.

   - Ensure sufficient color contrast to meet accessibility standards, making all materials easily readable for all users.
   - Utilize tools like [WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) to verify color combinations.

6. **Flexible Color Usage:**
   - Allow flexibility in design by using shades and tints of the assigned colors for different contexts (e.g., light backgrounds vs. dark text).
   - Maintain brand integrity by not deviating from the core color palette.

7. **Interactive Elements:**
   - Apply sub-brand colors to interactive elements (buttons, links, icons) to guide user actions and enhance user experience.

- Modular grid system to create balanced and clean layouts.
- Ample white space to separate content and reduce cognitive load.
- Grids ensure a consistent, predictable user experience, essential for trust in a financial product.
- White space gives the interface a sense of clarity, letting key calls to action stand out.
- Use a modular grid system (12-column layout) to maintain consistent spacing and alignment across Simora’s web pages, presentations, and marketing materials.
- Ample white space ensures a clean and modern look while keeping content digestible.

#### Hero Sections

- Each sub-brand’s hero section should prominently feature its unique gradient and tagline, visually tying it back to the overarching Simora brand.
- Example: "Simora Evolve: Guiding Businesses to Growth."

### Colour Applications

1. **Primary Colour Usage**:

   - **Simora Blue**: Overarching brand elements such as the main logo, headers, and navigation bars.
   - **Sub-Brand Colours**:
     - Evolve Green: Highlights consultancy-focused content.
     - Build Orange: Emphasises development services.
     - Ops Grey: Used in operational and data-driven contexts.

2. **Backgrounds**:

   - Use gradients sparingly to emphasise calls-to-action or hero banners.
   - Keep neutral white or grey for body text areas to maintain readability.

3. **Buttons and CTAs**:
   - Sub-brand buttons adopt their colour (e.g., green for Evolve CTAs) with hover effects that subtly darken or lighten the gradient.

### Typography and Font Hierarchy

1. **Headings**:

   - Use bold and slightly larger text sizes for H1 and H2 to create a clear visual hierarchy.
   - Example: H1 (48px), H2 (36px), H3 (24px).

2. **Body Text**:

   - Maintain a clean, sans-serif font at 16px with a line height of 1.5 for readability.

3. **Callouts and Highlights**:
   - Use colour highlights from the sub-brand palettes to draw attention to key text.
   - Italics or underline sparingly for emphasis.

### UI Elements

- **Consistency Across Sub-Brands**:

  - All interactive elements, such as buttons, cards, and modals, must follow a consistent design language to reinforce Simora’s unified identity.
  - Example: Rounded corners on buttons, shadows for depth, and hover animations.

- **Iconography**:
  - Use simple, modern icons aligned with each sub-brand’s theme.
  - Example: A compass icon for Simora Evolve, a gear for Simora Build, and a dashboard for Simora Ops.

#### Call-to-Actions (CTAs)

Direct, benefit-focused CTAs encourage users to take the next step. Visually appealing buttons increase click-through rates and maintain brand consistency.

- Prominent CTAs with clear, action-oriented text (e.g., "Start now," "Learn more").
- Buttons designed with gradients and hover effects to enhance interactivity.

### Motion and Animation

Motion provides visual feedback and conveys cutting-edge design. Keeping animations subtle avoids user fatigue and respects performance constraints.

- **Subtle Animations**:

  - Use animations like fade-ins, hover effects, and parallax scrolling to enhance the modern aesthetic.
  - Ensure animations are quick and non-intrusive, with durations between 150ms and 300ms.

- **Interactive Feedback**:
  - Buttons and links should provide hover states and subtle click animations to confirm user actions.

## Accessibility and Inclusivity

1. **Colour Contrast**:

   - Maintain a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for text against backgrounds to ensure readability.
   - Sub-brand colours and gradients should be tested for accessibility using tools like WCAG compliance checkers.

2. **Font Sizes and Spacing**:

   - Default to a base font size of 16px and ensure line spacing provides clear separation between text blocks.

- **Why**: A timeless brand ensures long-term recognition and prevents frequent rebranding efforts.

## Patterns and Background Textures

1. **Purpose and Use**

   - Use abstract or geometric patterns sparingly to accent key sections (e.g., header backgrounds or hero sections).
   - Simora often employs **soft gradients** and swirling wave motifs to underscore motion and innovation.

2. **Guidelines**
   - **Subtle Overlays**: Ensure the pattern does not compete with foreground content. Opacity typically around 5-15 percent.
   - **Placement**: Reserve bolder design elements for large headlines or hero images.
   - **Colour Harmony**: Pull from the core palette (purples, blues, teals) to maintain coherence.

**Why**:

- Patterns can reinforce Simora’s playful, dynamic identity, while carefully controlling their visual impact avoids overwhelming the user.

## Photography Guidelines

1. **Style**

   - **Bright and Modern**: Well-lit, clean imagery.
   - **Focus on People and Context**: Show practical usage of Simora's payments solutions.

2. **Composition**

   - **Negative Space**: Allows for text overlays and ensures clarity.
   - **Natural Poses**: Reflect real customer environments.

3. **Integration with Gradients**
   - Maintain contrast when overlaying text or images.
   - Consider black or white gradients if needed to ensure readability.

**Why**:

- Photography that shows Simora "in the wild" humanises the tech, reinforcing its utility and ease-of-use.

## Product / Feature Naming

1. **Consistency**

   - "Simora + [Product]" naming enforces brand recognition.
   - e.g., Simora Billing, Simora Radar, Simora Issuing.

2. **Hierarchical Clarity**

   - Major expansions keep "Simora" as the prefix.
   - Smaller tools or add-ons remain nested under the main product name.

3. **Documentation**
   - Keep an internal naming guide to prevent conflict or redundancy.
   - Pre-launch checks avoid legal or trademark issues.

**Why**:

- Names that follow a clear pattern make products easily discoverable and reinforce Simora as the central ecosystem.

## Colour Contrast Ratios

1. **Minimum Ratios**

   - **Body Text vs. Background**: 4.5:1
   - **Large Text or Headings**: 3:1
   - **Buttons and Icons**: 4.5:1

2. **Testing**
   - Carefully review multi-coloured backgrounds and gradients.
   - If necessary, add a subtle overlay to boost contrast.

**Why**:

- Accessible text improves usability for everyone, especially those with low vision or reading challenges.

### Appendix: Additional Use Cases

## Digital Email and Newsletter Guidelines

1. **Brand Consistency**

   - **Logos**: Always include the Simora logo in the header or footer, with appropriate spacing. Sub-brand logos may be used for context-specific content.
   - **Colours**: Use Simora Blue (#1F4B99) for headers and CTAs, with sub-brand colours for accents if the email focuses on Evolve, Build, or Ops.

2. **Layout**

   - Use a **single-column design** for clarity and compatibility across devices.
   - Maintain a 20px margin around all content blocks for readability.

3. **CTAs**

   - Primary CTAs should use gradient buttons (e.g., Simora Blue to Evolve Green).

   ```css
   .cta-button {
     background: linear-gradient(135deg, #1f4b99, #28a745);
     color: #ffffff;
     padding: 12px 24px;
     border-radius: 8px;
     font-weight: 600;
     text-align: center;
   }
   ```

   - Secondary links should remain plain text with underline styling for a professional look.

4. **Imagery**

   - Include relevant, high-quality images that highlight transformation, growth, or collaboration.
   - Ensure images are optimised for fast loading (72 DPI) and provide alt text for accessibility.

5. **Responsive Design**

   - Test emails for responsiveness on popular devices and clients (e.g., Gmail, Outlook).
   - Use scalable fonts and images to ensure readability across varying screen sizes.

6. **Text-Only Fallback**
   - Provide a plain-text version to accommodate email clients that block images or HTML.

**Why**:
Emails and newsletters are often the first touchpoint with clients, so maintaining brand consistency and ensuring usability across devices is critical for engagement.

## Social Media Guidelines

1. **Platform-Specific Adjustments**

   - **LinkedIn**: Focus on professional content, such as thought leadership articles, case studies, or testimonials.
   - **Twitter/X**: Use concise, benefit-driven posts with accompanying visuals or short videos.
   - **Instagram**: Highlight success stories and innovative designs using imagery or animations aligned with sub-brand colour palettes.

2. **Visuals**

   - Use **high-impact graphics** featuring gradients and bold typography.
   - Incorporate subtle animations or GIFs for engagement where supported.
   - Maintain a 1:1 or 4:5 aspect ratio for platforms like Instagram.

3. **Logo Usage**

   - Profile Picture: Always use the primary Simora logo for corporate accounts.
   - Sub-Brand Content: Overlay sub-brand logos in posts that focus on Evolve, Build, or Ops to provide context.

4. **Hashtags and Taglines**

   - Use branded hashtags to build recognition (e.g., #SimoraEvolve, #SimoraBuild).
   - Include taglines in visual assets or as part of captions to reinforce sub-brand identity.

5. **Call-to-Action (CTA)**

   - Provide platform-specific CTAs, such as:
     - "Explore more on our website."
     - "Discover how Simora Evolve can guide your business transformation."
   - Use platform-native features like LinkedIn lead forms or Instagram Stories swipe-ups for direct engagement.

6. **Tone and Messaging**

   - Keep the tone professional but approachable, focusing on benefits rather than features.
   - Use actionable language, e.g., "Transform your operations today with Simora Ops."

7. **Video Content**
   - Ensure videos are **under 60 seconds** for platforms like Instagram and Twitter, with subtitles for accessibility.
   - Use Simora’s primary and sub-brand colours in animated lower thirds, transitions, and callouts.

**Why**:
Social media allows Simora to engage directly with a diverse audience, making tailored content and consistent branding essential for maximising impact.

## Appendix: Simora CSS Design Considerations

This appendix interprets key insights from Stripe’s CSS analysis to outline Simora’s implementation strategies for themes, layouts, and interactive elements. These recommendations ensure consistency, adaptability, and scalability across Simora’s digital assets.

### 1. Theme Variants and Accent Classes

Simora’s CSS should include `.theme--` and `.accent--` classes to allow for environment-specific customisation:

- **Theme Classes**: `.theme--Light`, `.theme--Dark`, `.theme--SemiDark`, `.theme--Transparent`.

  - Use `--Light` for documentation and marketing materials.
  - Use `--Dark` or `--SemiDark` for dashboards and operational interfaces.

- **Accent Classes**: `.accent--EvolveGreen`, `.accent--BuildOrange`, `.accent--OpsGrey`.
  - Allow accents to align with sub-brands or promotional content.

**Why**:
These classes enable seamless adjustments across Simora’s web environments without fracturing its core identity.

### 2. Focus States and Accessibility

1. **Focus Indicators**:

   - Apply visible focus outlines using properties like:
     ```css
     :focus {
       box-shadow: 0 0 0 3px var(--focusColor);
     }
     ```
   - Use distinct focus colours for sub-brands: Evolve Green, Build Orange, and Ops Grey.

2. **Reduced Motion**:
   - Respect user preferences for reduced motion with `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` styles:
     ```css
     @media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
       * {
         animation: none;
         transition: none;
       }
     }
     ```

**Why**:
These considerations ensure accessibility for keyboard and assistive technology users while accommodating those with motion sensitivities.

### 3. Transitions and Motion Guidelines

1. **Standardised Transition Durations**:

   - Use variables like `--hoverTransition` for consistency:
     ```css
     .button {
       transition: var(--hoverTransition, all 200ms ease-in-out);
     }
     ```

2. **Animation Guidelines**:
   - Limit animations to subtle effects (e.g., hover lifts, fade-ins) to avoid overwhelming users.
   - Duration: 150-250ms for a polished feel.

**Why**:
Consistent transitions create a cohesive user experience, reinforcing Simora’s professional yet innovative tone.

### 4. Header, Menu, and Overlay Layouts

1. **Headers**:

   - Use `.SiteHeader` classes to define consistent navigation layouts with dropdowns and sticky positioning.

2. **Menus**:

   - `.MobileMenu` classes ensure responsive navigation with intuitive toggles for smaller screens.

3. **Overlays**:
   - Use `.Overlay--Modal` and `.Overlay--FullScreen` classes to maintain layering consistency.

**Why**:
Navigation elements are key touchpoints; consistent implementation enhances usability across devices.

### 5. Logo and Icon Treatments

1. **Logo Classes**:

   - `.SimoraLogo` for the primary brand mark, with size and colour variants:
     ```css
     .SimoraLogo--Small {
       width: 24px;
     }
     .SimoraLogo--Large {
       width: 120px;
     }
     ```

2. **Sub-Brand Logos**:

   - Use `.Logo--Evolve`, `.Logo--Build`, `.Logo--Ops` for sub-brand contexts.

3. **Icons**:
   - Maintain a standard set of sizes: 16px (small), 24px (medium), 48px (large).

**Why**:
These guidelines ensure logos and icons remain legible and recognisable across all touchpoints.

### 6. Layout Systems: Grid, Row, and Column

1. **Grid System**:

   - A **12-column grid** with 24px gutters for flexible, responsive layouts.

2. **Row and Column Classes**:
   - `.RowLayout` and `.ColumnLayout` define modular sections:
     ```css
     .RowLayout {
       display: flex;
       gap: 24px;
     }
     .ColumnLayout {
       flex: 1;
     }
     ```

**Why**:
Standardised layouts simplify design workflows and create a consistent visual structure.

### 7. Colour and Theme Variables

1. **Global Variables**:

   - Define colours and themes using CSS variables:
     ```css
     :root {
       --SimoraBlue: #1f4b99;
       --EvolveGreen: #28a745;
       --BuildOrange: #ff8c42;
       --OpsGrey: #6c757d;
       --BackgroundColor: #ffffff;
     }
     ```

2. **Theme Switching**:
   - Enable theme toggling by dynamically updating variables:
     ```css
     body.theme--Dark {
       --BackgroundColor: #24242e;
       --TextColor: #ffffff;
     }
     ```

**Why**:
Centralising colour and theme definitions ensures cohesive updates and rapid adjustments.

### 8. Shadows and Overlays

1. **Shadow Classes**:

   - Define consistent shadow tokens:
     ```css
     .Card--shadowSmall {
       box-shadow: 0px 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
     }
     .Card--shadowLarge {
       box-shadow: 0px 8px 16px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
     }
     ```

2. **Overlay Classes**:
   - Use `.Overlay--Modal` and `.Overlay--Backdrop` to standardise modal depths.

**Why**:
Unified shadows and overlays create a polished hierarchy and visual harmony.
