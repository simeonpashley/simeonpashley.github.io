Since taking over the role of Studio Head in October 2006 I redirected and specialised the studio as a dedicated Unreal Engine 3 specialist with a definite focus on quality. This involved strategic planning and partnerships with Epic to set this plan in motion and continue to work with them on promotions of the games.

Involved in a complete rebranding of the studio along with direction of the staff, strategic planning for the studio and also the corresponding marketing & awareness campaigns  including press & interviews where I worked with PR agents. In order to spread the message I regularly attend networking events and conferences to meet with past, current and future clients.

Grew the studio to work on 3 different next-gen titles simultaneously for PS3 and X360. Part of the re-direction included incorporating a more quality, time & cost efficient distributed work model including setting up relationships with key outsource companies worldwide.
