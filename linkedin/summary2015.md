I'm the Group CTO for Approved Group, an e-commerce business who also develop & own their software intellectual property. In this role I lead the company's technology efforts, overseeing a small team. The most exciting work to date is seeing the company grow on top of the suite of software I have made ranging from the e-commerce site itself through to more complex internal systems for pick, pack & ship as well as cloud based & data driven enterprise analysis, sales & marketing, customer analysis, product management and much more; it is very sophisticated. Much larger high-street businesses have expressed interest in using these systems as they claim they are "streets ahead" of what else is available.


Before joining Approved Group, I worked for Sony PlaySation as Executive Producer. I was responsible for 50% of externally developed PlayStation games in Europe with an annual budget over â‚¬20M.


I am passionate about my work and I look forward to opportunities to learn & grow. I enjoy all aspects of my work but my favourite has to be creating new projects and seeing them add genuine value to the business.


I have been developing software since 1986 and have held a variety of roles including Group CTO, Executive Producer, Studio Head, Development Director, Technical Director.


My long career has given me a fully rounded skillset covering Software Engineering, Dev Ops, Technological Infrastructure Management, Scrum & Agile Project Management, Budgeting, Programming, Sales, Marketing, Recruitment, Team Management and Strategic Planning.
