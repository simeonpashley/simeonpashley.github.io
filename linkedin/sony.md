**Key Achievements**

_Buzz!_

I completely changed the strategy for the Buzz! franchise to improve it's profitability whilst maintaining it's high quality bar and innovating within the genre.

This involved deep analysis and tuning of the development costs, licensing costs, game metrics, release plans, focus groups, retail reports, process and existing agreements. This resulted in fewer releases but each one of higher quality, reduced overhead costs, highly successful Home space, supporting DLC strategy, social network integration, pushing into online only markets and much more.

_Heavy Rain_

As Executive Producer on this title I ensured the product was on time as I inherited it for the last 33% of it's production life. This title was highly innovative and released to critical acclaim.
