When code is changed, YOU MUST:

1. Verify all components have tests
2. Ensure the tests follow best practices
3. Run all tests to ensure they pass
4. Check for any linting errors
5. Verify the test coverage is sufficient, if not then enhance tests

- Before a commit: the full test & lint suite be ran and must not fail.
- Embed `docs/avoidable.md` in the prompt

- WHEN A BUG IS VERIFIED FIXED: Append (DO NOT REMOVE EXISTING) concise unambigous rules to `docs/avoidable.md` that will mitigate avoidable errors found during bug fixing
