Hi, my name is Simeon and I've been a professional software developer since 1986.

- I am very passionate about building great software with good business value.
- I have a strong work ethic and I will do whatever it takes to deliver great results.

**SNIP**

2016- I've taken to maintaining my history exclusively on [LinkedIn]({{ site.owner.linkedin_url }}) page.

Roles include: Solutions Architect, Technical Director, Executive Producer, Project Manager and Software Developer to name but a few.

## About the Site

I initially registered the domain `pashley.org` back in 2002 to enable me to setup a friendly email domain for my family and also provide a nice domain for my personal web precense.

Calling this site a "blog" is probably generous as it's more like a random collection of my thoughts that I want to keep online and share, sometimes connected, often rare. I go through fits & starts of writing so you'll probably see huge gaps in time.

I've had various random sites since the mid-1990s on [tripod.com](http://tripod.com), [blogspot.com](http://blogger.com) (before it became blogger) and a myriad of others. I'm currently going right back to basics using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) hosted on [Github Pages](http://github.com/).
