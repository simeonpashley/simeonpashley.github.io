<p>There are many ways to communicate with people, what’s your preference?</p>
<p>I have to admit that I find telephone conversations the hardest, they fall between the disconnection of something like email or status updates and the ‘proper’ face-to-face meetings we have with people every day. Telephone conversations also tend to be one-to-one too, conference calls are a nightmare. There’s no visual clues on when it’s anyone's time to talk or how people are reacting.</p>
<p>We all know It’s entirely possible to hide behind emails, you can spend hours crafting every word, editing and re-editing until your happy.</p>
<p>Meeting up with people is always fun, the spontaneity and interaction obviously surpasses everything else.</p>
<p>I’d rather write a long, carefully crafted email or make a long distance journey to meet up than make a call.</p>
<p>Everyone’s different, do you have a preference?</p>
