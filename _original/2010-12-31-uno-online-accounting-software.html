    'Uno' is a custom written Accountancy Software Service  package, entirely developed by Ring Alpha.

    Uno is to be rolled out by an Accountancy Partner as a public face to their clients and also used for their internal accounting and auditing purposes. Beyond this we envisage the software being made available to other accountancy firms to roll out to their clients.

<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-109" style="margin: 10px; border: 0px initial initial;" title="Money" src="assets/4QUPD00Z.jpg" alt="" width="203" height="270" />I have also been working for a while now on a commissioned online accountancy package, provisionally called '<strong>Uno</strong>'. The work is entirely developed by Ring Alpha.</p>
<div style="clear:both;border:1px solid #800;padding:10px; margin:10px;"><strong>UPDATE:</strong> We will be looking for Beta testers soon. Please <a href="/contact">contact us</a> if you'd like to be involved.</div>
<p>Uno is to be used by an Account partnership to roll out as a public face to their clients and for their internal accounting and auditing purposes. Beyond this we envisage the software being made available to other accountancy firms to roll out to their clients.</p>
<p>The  online accounting is specifically targeted at UK small business, soul traders and contractors and the final product will be rolled out mid-2011. The software is specifically written for UK tax law and is also backed up by a group of professional accountants to ensure a complete service.</p>
<p>The emphasis of the online accounting software is to provide a simple, error free way for business to perform simple book keeping whilst maintaining the level of detail and logging that accountancy requires in order to do their diligent work. The supporting Accountants can move the data into more comprehensive packages such as Sage for complete analysis.</p>
<p>It features areas dedicated to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Banks</li>
<li>Clients</li>
<li>Suppliers</li>
<li>Invoicing</li>
<li>Expenses</li>
<li>Payment tracking</li>
<li>Reporting</li>
</ul>
<p>The software itself is written on a robust and secure PHP framework called <a href="http://codeigniter.com/">Code Igniter</a> with many custom written enhancements to improve authentication and security to ensure the data is kept very safe from prying eyes. The site also includes Google's <a href="http://www.google.com/recaptcha">reCAPTCHA</a> authentication to further enhance security.</p>
<p>The user interface is built using good design principles and incorporates the latest UI technology such as <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> to ensure a great experience.</p>
<p>Uno, the online accountancy software will be ready during 2011 so watch this space for more information.</p>
