<p>I spend a lot of my time keeping in touch with what's going off in the Games Industry and I thought it worthwhile sharing&nbsp;7 of my favourite Games Industry <a href="http://blog.gamefreelancing.com/p/what-is-rss.html">RSS</a> Feeds to keep you all up-to-date.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>I personally subscribe to these via <a href="http://www.google.com/reader">Google Reader</a>, which I find to be an excellent way to keep everything in 1 place and really get the most out of my valuable time. I'd recommend taking this habit up if you haven't already.
<ol>
<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><a href="http://www.develop-online.net/" target="_blank" title="Develop Magazine Online">Develop Online</a> - This is a little bit of a cheat as Develop splits it's feeds into 3 topics: regular, Blog and Feature so you can choose which is best for you. I tend to go for all 3 as it's always a fantastic read and much of the content appears way ahead of it's paper variant through the post. I like seeing people I know with their names up there and also spotting pictures of them too.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><a href="http://www.gamesindustry.biz/" target="_blank" title="GI">GamesIndustry.Biz</a> - This <b>used</b> to be my most visited UK-centric industry feed and it proudly sat at the top of my Google Reader list. It got bumped down my list because you now have to register to read full articles, which you don't have to on other sites. It's still great, just not as convenient as it used to be.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/" target="_blank" title="Gamasutra - The Art &amp; Business of Computer Games">Gamasutra</a> - This was <b><i>the <span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-style: normal;">game industry web-site a few years ago as it was pretty much the only one. In addition to it's US based news feed, it's packed full of useful articles, interviews and reviews of all things to do with game development.</span></span></i></b></li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><b><i><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-style: normal;"><a href="http://www.tipb.com/" target="_blank" title="The iPhone Blog">The iPhone Blog</a> - in their own words "The #1 iPhone, iPad and iPod touch blog!". Strong words but this is a useful little site that also sucks in other smartphone info too. I believe it's important to always keep your eye on the periphery to make sure you don't miss out on something.</span></span></i></b></li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><b><i><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-style: normal;"><a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/" target="_blank" title="Kotaku">Escapist Magazine</a> - pretty much the only popular games feed I read as it tends to have the most interesting articles, interviews and genuine reviews. I also regularly visit many of it's sister sites.</span></span></i></b></li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><b><i><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-style: normal;"><a href="http://blog.eu.playstation.com/" target="_blank" title="PlayStation.Blog (Europe)">PlayStation.Blog (Europe)</a> - A blog dedicated to all things specific to PlayStation in Europe, including specials, interviews, previews and sometimes limited Beta codes. Again, used to work for Sony Europe so I like to see the products coming through and the people I know doing well.</span></span></i></b></li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><b><i><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-style: normal;"><a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/live/engineeringblog/" target="_blank" title="PlayStation.Blog (Europe)">XBox Engineering</a> - This feed a little 'tech thirst' for me and it's a great insight into some of the tech that MS publish to show 'under the hood' of their SDKs.</span></span></i></b></li>
</ol>
<p>What about you? Do you have sites that you visit regularly? Have I missed a 'must see' site?</p>
