<p>Yes. Now.<br />
I am an artist. • I take initiative • I do the work, not the job. • Without critics,<br />
there is no art. • I am a Linchpin. I am not easily replaced. • If it’s never been<br />
done before, even better. • The work is personal, too important to phone in. •<br />
The lizard brain is powerless in the face of art. • I make it happen. Every day. •<br />
Every interaction is an opportunity to make a connection. • The past is gone. It<br />
has no power. The future depends on choices I make now. • I own the means of<br />
production—the system isn’t as important as my contribution to it. • I see the<br />
essential truth unclouded by worldview, and that truth drives my decisions. • I<br />
lean into the work, not away from it. Trivial work doesn’t require leaning. •<br />
Busywork is too easy. Rule-breaking works better and is worth the effort. •<br />
Energy is contagious. The more I put in, the more the world gives back. • It<br />
doesn’t matter if I’m always right. It matters that I’m always moving. • I raise the<br />
bar. I know yesterday’s innovation is today’s standard. • I will not be<br />
brainwashed into believing in the status quo. • Artists don’t care about credit.<br />
We care about change. • There is no resistance if I don’t allow it to defeat me. •<br />
I embrace a lack of structure to find a new path. • I am surprising. (And often<br />
surprised). • I donate energy and risk to the cause. • I turn charisma into<br />
leadership. • The work matters. • Go. Make something happen.</p>
