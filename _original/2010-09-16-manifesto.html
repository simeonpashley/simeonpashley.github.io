<p>The <em>The Linchpin Manifesto</em> take from Seth Godin's book '<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0749953357/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=0749953357&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=gamedevelcons-21" target="_blank"><em>Linchpin: Are You Indispensable? How to drive your career and create a remarkable future</em></a>' is something I truly believe in and affects every aspect of my life.</p>

<p>I am an artist. · I take initiative · I do the work, not the job. · Without critics, there is no art. · <strong>I am a Linchpin. I am not easily replaced.</strong> · If it’s never been done before, even better. · The work is personal, too important to phone in. · The lizard brain is powerless in the face of art. · I make it happen. Every day. · <strong>Every interaction is an opportunity to make a connection.</strong> · The past is gone. It has no power. The future depends on choices I make now. · I own the means of production—the system isn’t as important as my contribution to it. · I see the essential truth unclouded by worldview, and that truth drives my decisions. · I lean into the work, not away from it. <strong>Trivial work doesn’t require leaning.</strong> · Busywork is too easy. Rule-breaking works better and is worth the effort. · Energy is contagious. The more I put in, the more the world gives back. · It doesn’t matter if I’m always right. It matters that <em><strong>I’m always moving</strong>.</em> · I raise the bar. I know yesterday’s innovation is today’s standard. · I will not be brainwashed into believing in the status quo. · <strong>Artists don’t care about credit. We care about change.</strong> · There is no resistance if I don’t allow it to defeat me. · I embrace a lack of structure to find a new path. · I am surprising. (And often surprised). · I donate energy and risk to the cause. · I turn charisma into leadership. · The work matters. · <strong>Go. Make something happen.</strong></div>
<h3>Professional Manifesto</h3>
<h4>1. Provide a bridge between the outside world and the company</h4>
<p>I aim to connect people who need connecting with authority and clarity. I always represent the company, the project and its people in a collaborative, positive and open manner.</p>
<h4>2. Deliver Unique Creativity</h4>
<p>My extensive knowledge of computer video games, trust imparted by the people I work with and my work ethic blend together to produce unique ideas that no-one else will envisage.</p>
<h4>3. Manage situations and organisations of great flexibility</h4>
<p>I can provide complete solutions for problems, clearly seeing simple paths through the complex fog of development and provide direction for the project and people. I have relevant experience of leading people &amp; managing organisations through times of great change and pressure to reach our goal.</p>
<h4>4. Interact fluidly with customers</h4>
<p>I aim to work pro-actively and closely with customers to ensure that they are well-informed and their feedback is considered. I have direct experience of working with real-world brands.</p>
<h4>5. Inspire Staff</h4>
<p>I keep the team moving in the right direction, nudging, pushing and coarse correcting to maximise everyone’s potential and ship the game. I provide a good example to staff, sharing knowledge with them and learning from them. I treat our collaboration with respect and trust.</p>
<h4>6. Provide Deep Domain Knowledge</h4>
<p>I have a great deal of knowledge and expertise in making computer games including commercial, people and, of course, production. My knowledge is always up-to-date and I constantly acquire new understanding with every book, technology, web-site, person I interact with and, of course, games I make and play.</p>
<h3>Personal Stance</h3>
<p>1. <strong>Be open, honest and transparent </strong>in all actions and communication. I say it like it is, good &amp; bad and strive to provide solutions. There is no hidden agenda and I always share everything.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Be conscientious</strong>, working in computer games is much more than just paying the bills for me. I love not only making and playing computer games but also connecting with people at all levels.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Bring emotionally stability</strong> to a wide variety of situations. Engage with people and lead them through times of chaos and stress with clarity and authority. I have experienced most situations, which enables me to communicate from a genuine position of understanding.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Be flexible about the role</strong>, I typically do whatever it takes, within reason, to make the project successful. I have a broad range of experience that enables me to understand and act across a variety of roles.</p>
<p>5. <strong>Be reasonably priced</strong>. Unlike a stereotypical freelancer, I don’t aim to make an excessive amount of cash. I aim to add value in all my interactions and I am pragmatic about roles I undertake. I also derive value from the connections and knowledge acquired through our relationship.</p>
