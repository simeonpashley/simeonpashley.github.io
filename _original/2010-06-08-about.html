<p>Game Linchpin is a web-site setup dedicated to act as a repository for all the things I've learned during my career so far and things I pick up on a regular basis.</p>
<p>My blog focuses on interesting articles about Game Development, Production, Career, Business, Contracts, Finance, People and much more.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy Game Linchpin and join in the conversation. I can't wait to hear from you.</p>

<p><strong>Why Blog?</strong><br />
As the owner and originator, I started to put together this blog to share all the knowledge I've acquired over the years in a hope that someone else can enjoy it and make use of it.</p>
<p>I also wanted to bring in some of my experienced friends too and give them a voice, as they are often the unsung heroes of game development, often plug away behind the lines, making a solid difference in the projects they work on.</p>
