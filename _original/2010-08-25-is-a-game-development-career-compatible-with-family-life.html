<p><!--a13f8eb21f9441fbbb28132163135ec8-->I've been following the thread over on Luke's blog entitled <a href="http://lukehalliwell.wordpress.com/2010/08/19/goodbye-realtime-worlds/">'Goodbye, Realtime Worlds'</a> and I've commented in there when the discussion turned to the collateral effects that being made redundant has in an industry that's so sparsely spread around the globe. The discussion isn't about overtime in the short-term, it's more about long-term careers in games when you've got other people to think about in your life.  Maybe your partner has a great job, maybe you've got other businesses you're involved with, maybe you've got children?</p>
<p>It got me wondering what everyone else's experience is like.</p>
<p><strong>What compromises have you made to balance your career and family?</strong></p>
