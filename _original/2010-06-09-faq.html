This blog expresses my personal opinions, and not those of my current or past employers.</div>
<p><b>How do I keep track of Game Linchpin?</b> – I've often been asked "How do I get automatic updates?" so I've written a nice simple to follow guide on how to <a href="subscribe-to-game-linchpin.html">Subscribe To Updates</a> for Game Linchpin including Social Networks, RSS Feeds and EMail updates too.</p>
<p><b>May I republish posts from Game Linchpin on my own Blog?</b> – You may not republish full posts from Game Linchpin without my direct permission. You can re-use the add paragraph or two for non-commercial purposes but all I ask is that you link back to this blog.</p>

Comment Policy</h1>
<p>1. Comments are actively encouraged - they are as important as anything I write myself. They add to the knowledge and community that we have here. If you want to comment then you’re more than welcome – whether you feel you are a beginner or an expert – feel free to have you say.</p>
<p>2. I delete spam – My comment provider has spam filters in place which automatically catch the majority of automated spam comments. However, if any end up on here then I will delete them straight away.</p>
<p>3. Relevant links in comments are actively encouraged - if you’re leaving a comment on my blogs and want to point to a link on your own or someone else’s site that is relevant to the topic then please feel free to do so. This adds to the conversation and improves the blog.</p>
<p>4. Irrelevant links are not encouraged – if you leave a comment with a link in it that has no relevance to the post you’re commenting on it could be be deleted.</p>
<p>5. I allow signatures in comments - I don’t really see the need for them and see them as verging on the spammy end of comments. However, I decided not to delete comments with signatures as long as the comments were relevant and added something to the conversation. ie if you write a comment that says ‘nice’ or ‘good post’ or ‘great blog’ or ‘try viagra’ and then leave a signature on your comment then it could well be deleted.</p>
