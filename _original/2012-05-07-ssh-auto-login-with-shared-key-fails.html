<p>I recently had trouble when my SSH auto-login via shared key failed and it took a while to figure out what was wrong. I've made some notes for posterity. It turned out to be SSH not being happy with the directory/file ownership and permission on both the target and client.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h2>Finding the problem</h2>
<p>When running Centos it's important to ensure that SSHD logging is on so you can discover what's wrong and also track login attempts.</p>
<p>Enable logging for sshd by editing the config file</p>
<pre>$ nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config</pre>
<p>Locate the following and make the changes:</p>
<pre># Logging
 # obsoletes QuietMode and FascistLogging
 <strong>SyslogFacility AUTH</strong>
 <strong>#SyslogFacility AUTHPRIV</strong>
 <strong>LogLevel INFO</strong></pre>
<p>Don't forget to restart the service to apply the changes</p>
<pre>$ /etc/init.d/sshd restart</pre>
<p><strong>Check the logs</strong></p>
<p>With logging enabled you can now watch the end of the <em>messages</em> log where you should find the error messages. I did this with 2 boxes open. Box 1 was logged into the target and watching the logs while Box 2 attempt to login.</p>
<pre>$ tail -f -n 100 /var/log/messages</pre>
<p>In my scenario this immediately presented the following message:</p>
<pre>Â Authentication refused: bad ownership or modes for directory /root</pre>
<h2><strong>Fixing The Problem</strong></h2>
<p>It turns out something had changed the owner and permissions on my <em>/root</em> directory and SSH didn't like it. I have yet to find out how &amp; when this happened but I suspect a system wide update via 'yum update' did it.</p>
<p>Here's the commands I ran on the target:</p>
<pre>$ chown root:root /root</pre>
<pre>$ chmod 755 /root</pre>
<p>This immediately produced a new error on the client side when attempting the SSH login:</p>
<pre>@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
@ WARNING: UNPROTECTED PRIVATE KEY FILE! @
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Permissions 0755 for '/root/.ssh/id_rsa' are too open.
It is recommended that your private key files are NOT accessible by others.
This private key will be ignored.</pre>
<p>This simple error was fixed on the client by issuing:</p>
<pre>$ chmod 700 /root/.ssh/id_rsa</pre>
<p>Fixing the above problems on the target and client enabled me to auto-login on SSH using shared RSA keys. Note: these fixes didn't require any changes to the keys as they were purely down to permissions and ownership.</p>
