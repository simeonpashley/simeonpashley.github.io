<p>Hi all, just a quick not to say I've been a bit busy these last few days so there's a bit of a gap in my posts. Normal service will be resumed soon.</p>
<p>Why not check out the <a title="Archives" href="/archives">archives</a>, join us on twitter @simeonpashley or <a href="/book-shelf">read a book</a> while I get back up to speed. :)</p>
<p>Simeon</p>
