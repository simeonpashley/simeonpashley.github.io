<h3>How does Pay Per Click work?</h3>
<p><strong>Pay Per Click</strong> means that your business is at the top of a top Search Engine, and more companies are seeing the results of investing in Pay Per Click advertising.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-288" style="margin: 5px;" title="Sales grow through pay per click" src="assets/pay-per-click-graph.gif" alt="" width="200" height="153" /></p>
<p>The reason  is that the more people search for a keyword that is in the field of your business, they can see your advertisement immediately in the Pay Per Click section of the specific search engine and this ultimately generates interest.</p>
<p>Pay Per Click ensures your business is advertised on a top search engine on the first page. This is especially effective if your business is highly competitive and needs to bypass the competition for a spot on the first page.</p>
<h3>Why pay for Pay Per Click?</h3>
<p>The reason is simple. It will benefit your company with immediate effect. With search engines being the biggest source for research and contacts, there is no disputing that Pay Per Click can be a huge advantage for a business’s marketing strategy.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-289" title="Pay Per Click global customers" src="assets/earth.gif" alt="" width="150" height="155" />You as a customer also decide how much you wish to pay. The budget is in your hands. Once you have decided the key phrases of your business, you need to set a limit on how many people you wish to see your site, then budget for each day.</p>
<p>This is not as complicated as it sounds, and don’t forget, even if you have a low budget, being on the first page of a search engine is a hard feat if not using Pay Per Click.</p>
<p>The key to successful PPC is to accurately measure the ROI of each keyword or phrase you bid for, then reallocate your advertising spend accordingly. It’s about making every penny of your budget work as hard as possible.</p>
<p>Of course, if you would prefer to manage your own success, for a one off fee we can set up an account which allows you to monitor how many Pay Per Click’s you receive each day.</p>
