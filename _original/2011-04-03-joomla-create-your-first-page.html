<p> I'll educate you on how to set up pages with static content.</p>
<p>For starters, it's best to log in to your web-site Administration Area.</p>
<p>Then select Content --> Article Manager. Also, you could click Article Manager icon inside your Administration home page. Inside Article Manager you could find a summary of your web site content web pages. When your in the beginning stages this can be a listing of all the default Joomla articles.  You'll be able to simply select the checkbox on the left, simply select the ones you don't wish published, and then on top right, mouse click "unpublish."</p>
<p>To create a new web page, push New at the top right of the webpage.</p>
<p>At present you are on a page where you may generate your articles. You will see many fields:</p>
<p>    * Title: Give the website page a title. It should be quick along with detailed (ex: 'About Us');</p>
<p>    * Alias: You can also make a title easy to remember in your web page. In case you leave this field blank Joomla ! will make an alias from the page title changing spaces by hyphens. (i.e.: about-us  should your website page title is 'About Us');</p>
<p>    * Section: Choose a category to your website page. If you don't have any, select 'Uncategorized'. This field is required and your article won't be published if you leave '-Select Section-' value in the field;</p>
<p>    * Published: Here you may change your page publish state. You can check 'No' radio press button if you do not desire your article to be published. This field is defined as 'Yes' by default;</p>
<p>    * Front Page: This field establishes whether your web page shall be viewable on the front page of your website or not;</p>
<p>    * Category: Decide on a category to your static subject material website page. For those who have no categories or perhaps will not need your article to be in any kind of category, select'Uncategorized';</p>
<p>    * Text: Type the text here. Here's your static webpage. Available for you the TinyMCE incorporated editor or perhaps download and install some really improved upon editors and use them to be able to develop your own pages. We would suggest to give JCE a look at.</p>
<p>On the right side you find the article's synopsis and three sections meant for advanced settings.</p>
<p>Setting the Parameters (Article):</p>
<p>    * Author: You may want to have various authors on your site thus if you wish to personalize your document, go with a name from the list;</p>
<p>    * Author Alias: The same as with Article Alias - ensure it is understandable or Joomla ! is going to do that on your behalf. This is going to help when you've got many authors writing for ones webpage;</p>
<p>    * Access Level: Right here you've got three choices: Public, Registered and Specials. Decide on who will check out your article plus who will definitely not;</p>
<p>    * Created date: While default today's time is set in this field. However you could make make it  published earlier.</p>
<p>    * Start Publishing: Revise this date if you want your article to get published later on. It becomes published at time needed;</p>
<p>    * Finish Publishing: When you wish the page to become posted for a limited time type here the date (and hour) when you wish your own posting to get unpublished. This function is additionally automatic.</p>
<p>Parameters (Advanced):</p>
<p>Most of these kinds of fields are actually arranged as 'Use Global'. The best way should be to set the most appropriate fields in Parameters (that may be found in Article Manager) and modify many of them for each article if required. Let me explainthe work of each field in another tutorial.</p>
<p>Metadata Information:</p>
<p>    * Description: It is a field in which you enter text to your meta description tag. It is vital making it informative together with describing the content to your page. Maintain it to remain descriptive and quick about 156 characters.</p>
<p>    * Keywords: Here you can add keywords your page is optimized for search engines. They'll be combined with your meta keywords tag.  Numerous pros feel that keywords shall no longer be used by search engines; and we would likely agree; however, you can still include all of them if you like.</p>
<p>    * Author: This discipline will add meta author tag to the page. Just about worthless from the SEO point as search engines won't pay that attention to almost all meta tags.</p>
<p>    * Robots: You should minimize crawlers' access to the written content which is not for any person to uncover on a search engine. If you do, make sure you put values "noindex, nofollow". There's only four values just for this field - index, noindex, follow, nofollow. But yet you should use only 2 of these separated by comma.</p>
<p>When finished, just be sure you look at your spelling, examine all fields and push 'Save'.</p>
<p>Now you have completed your brand-new 'About Us' web page and it's time to design your Menu link for this web page.</p>
