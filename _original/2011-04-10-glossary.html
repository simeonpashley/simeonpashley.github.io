<p>We try to keep things simple and explain things in plain english but sometimes the odd acronym pops into our language. Whether you're new to the web or not sure about some new acronym we're here to help with our handy list of Internet Terms and Acronyms.</p>
<p>If there's something missing, drop us a line and we'll help you out.</p>
<h2>SEO - Search Engine Optimisation</h2>
<p>Search Engine Optimisation is the action of act of improving a websites position in Search Engine Results Pages by making changes to the website itself and the links to it from around the web.</p>
<h2>PPC - Pay Per Click</h2>
<p>Paid for internet advertising Pay Per Click advertising is found all around the internet. Advertisers make bids to effectively buy advertising for keywords, such as "iphone 4", on the assumption the viewer clicks on the advert and ends up on your website. Payments are only made to the advert network such as Google Adwords when a viewer clicks.</p>
<h2>Conversion</h2>
<p>When a visitor makes a purchase or finds a target page on your website (e.g., Contact page) they have been "converted" from a vistor to a customer.</p>
<h2>CRO - Conversion Rate Optimisation | LPO - Landing Page Optimisation</h2>
<p>Visitors to your website can leave at any point between the point at which they view your first page to the point that they pay for your product or click your 'Send Message' button.<br />
Improving the chances that your visitor "convert" can be achieved by changing anything from colours on your buttons, words on your pages or layout of your site.</p>
<h2>Bounce Rate</h2>
<p>You've worked on your SEO, you've got loads of back links and yet your sales aren't quite where you expect them to be.</p>
<p>If visitors don't find what they or expect or your content is too difficult to find they will "bounce" from your website into the arms of one of your competitors. Reducing the bounce rate can be achieved by working on your website content along with a mix of landing page optimisation.</p>
<h2><a name="g_bandwidth"></a>Bandwidth</h2>
<p>A term used by web hosts to describe how much data can pass from the server your website is hosted on to people visiting your web site. This includes the files that make up your website as well as any data downloaded from databases or media files.</p>
<h2><a name="g_tld"></a>ccTLD</h2>
<p>A country code top level domain name. These domain names are associated with a country or geographic location e.g. .co.uk (UK), .fr (France and .cn (China). The ability to register these domain names from another country depends on the registrar's rules. For example, co.uk has no restrictions whereas .it (Italy) demands you are based in Europe.</p>
<h2><a name="g_dns"></a>Domain Name System (DNS)</h2>
<p>The system that maps domain names to the corresponding machine's IP addresses. This system is essentially a phone book that translates human friendly names into computer friendly numbers. Because this information is stored across multiple computers any updates to a domain (including registration and ownership details) can take up to 48 hours to work its way across all of them.</p>
<h2><a name="g_ftp"></a>File Transfer Protocol (FTP)</h2>
<p>Once you are ready to see what your website looks like online, uploading the files to your web space is really easy and is often as simple as clicking, dragging and dropping. The method you will use to get your website online is called File Transfer Protocol (FTP). Don't be put off by the name, all this does is take the files from your computer and put them on to the web host's server for people to access. Simple!</p>
<p>In order to do this your web host may offer an upload function though your account with them, but that means you have to log in every time. A quicker alternative that most people use is FTP software. Some HTML editors come with this built in (e.g. Dreamweaver &amp; Microsoft Expression Web) but even if yours doesn't there is the industry standard stand alone (which is free) to download called FileZilla.</p>
<h2><a name="g_html"></a>HTML</h2>
<p>HTML (Hyper Text Mark-up Language) is the first layer of a web page and deals with the content (the text, any lists, tables, quotes...).</p>
<h2><a name="g_lamp"></a>LAMP</h2>

<strong>Linux: </strong>Operating system</p>
<p><strong>Apache:</strong> Web server</p>
<p><strong>MySQL: </strong>Database</p>
<p><strong>PHP: </strong>Program</p>
<h2>MySQL</h2>
<p>MySQL (owned and developed by Sun Microsystems) is the world's most popular open source database. It is also part of the open source software stack known as LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP).</p>
<h2>Sub-Domain</h2>
<p>Sub-domain names are domains that are part of the parent domain name. They are free to set up and can be useful if you have areas of your site you want to categorise e.g.<br />
dictionary.domain.com, thesaurus.domain.com</p>
<h2>TLD</h2>
<p>Top Level Domain Names have no association with any countries and were amongst the first to be created. E.g. .com, .net, .org.</p>
<h2>Web Space</h2>
<p>The amount of space allocated to your website by a web host to store all your files and data. The more web space you have the more information you can store.</p>
