<p>The GBBO initiative is setup by partners such as Google, BT and Enterprise UK to help businesses understand the importance of having an internet presence and creating their own website. Ring Alpha Web Design are fully subscribed partners to this business initiative.</p>
<h2>Benefits for Businesses</h2>
<p>With at least 41 million people in the UK online there has never been a better time for small businesses to get online with their first website.</p>
<p>A website is a great way of <strong>attracting new customers</strong> or engaging with existing ones, but many businesses aren't online yet because they think its either too costly, too complicated, not necessary, or often all three!</p>
<h2>For businesses without a website</h2>
<p>Our range of affordable Web Design packages include everything you need to get started.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Website address</strong>: Choose from any available '.co.uk' website address. If the address is already taken, we'll suggest available alternatives</li>
<li><strong>A customised website</strong></li>
<li><strong>Online marketing:</strong> All sites created will be indexed by Google, enabling users to easily and quickly find businesses online</li>
<li>1yr <strong>FREE hosting</strong> hosting</li>
</ol>
<h2>For businesses with a website</h2>
<p>Improve your business on the web with a more professional web design, Website Health Check or our Search Engine Optimisation.</p>
<h2>Why choose professional web design?</h2>
<p>While a entirely free website provided by Google Sites will get you something online, it certainly won't be pretty and it's likely to turn the few customers away that do stumble across it.</p>
<p>Remember, a website is the public face of your business, which should be professional, well designed and make it easy for customers to find your products & services and ultimately connect with your business.</p>
<p>This is the difference between a website and a successful online business, the difference between 0 visitors and customers!</p>
<p>We make great websites that really put your business on the web.</p>
<h2>Call us</h2>
