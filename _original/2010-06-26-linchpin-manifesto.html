<h3><strong>Yes. Now.</strong></h3>
<p>I am an artist. • I take initiative • I do the work, not the job. • Without critics, there is no art. • <span style="color: #993300;"><strong>I am a Linchpin. I am not easily replaced</strong></span><strong>.</strong> • If it’s never been done before, even better. • The work is personal, too important to phone in.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>• The lizard brain is powerless in the face of art. • I make it happen. Every day. • <span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong>Every interaction is an opportunity to make a connection</strong></span><strong>.</strong><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>• The past is gone. It has no power. The future depends on choices I make now. • I own the means of production—the system isn’t as important as my contribution to it. • I see the essential truth unclouded by worldview, and that truth drives my decisions. • I lean into the work, not away from it. <span style="color: #99cc00;"><strong>Trivial work doesn’t require leaning.</strong></span> • Busywork is too easy. Rule-breaking works better and is worth the effort. • Energy is contagious. The more I put in, the more the world gives back. • It doesn’t matter if I’m always right. It matters that <em><span style="color: #33cccc;">I’m always moving</span></em>. • I raise the bar. I know yesterday’s innovation is today’s standard. • I will not be brainwashed into believing in the status quo. •<span style="color: #008080;"> <strong>Artists don’t care about credit. We care about change.</strong></span> • There is no resistance if I don’t allow it to defeat me. • I embrace a lack of structure to find a new path. • I am surprising. (And often surprised). • I donate energy and risk to the cause. • I turn charisma into leadership. • The work matters. • <span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>Go. Make something happen.</strong></span></p>
