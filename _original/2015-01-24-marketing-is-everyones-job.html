<p>In a world of freelancers, contractors and small, tight development communities. Everyone is on the public face of their business and reputation.

<div>We are all constantly marketing something, be it our company or ourselves in one shape or another. Everything we do matters - your web-site, your comments in forums, the clothes you wear. It's about the message we convey in our appearance, our design, our gameplay, our technology, our ethics and most importantly our interactions with others. The sooner we realise this the better.</div>
