<p>Ring Alpha recently undertook the task of <strong>setting up and migrating</strong> a complete business over to the cloud. The task included migrating all of the User Accounts, Email, Documents, Calendars and Contacts to <strong>Google Applications for Business</strong>.<br />
If you're thinking about improving your availability, cost savings and ensuring your documents are backed up and shared then <strong>give Ring Alpha a call to see how we can help you migrate</strong><!--more--><br />

<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-465" title="Google Apps" src="assets/google-apps-graphic.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="400" /><br />
Google Applications represents significant benefits over hosting your own services and here are a few key reasons:</p>
<div class="section">
<h3>Proven cost savings</h3>
<p>Google's web-based messaging and collaboration apps require no hardware or software and<br />
need minimal administration, creating tremendous time and cost savings for businesses.</p>
<p>End users can use the familiar Microsoft Outlook<br />
interface for email, contacts and calendar as they transition to Gmail and Google<br />
Calendar.</p>
<p>A leading research firm found that Google Apps is as little as 1/3 the total cost of<br />
competing solutions.</p>
<p>Want to see how much you could save with Google Apps compared to Microsoft Exchange 2007?</p>
<h3>50 times more storage than the industry average</h3>
<p>Each employee gets 25 GB for email storage, so they can keep important messages and find<br />
them instantly with built-in Google search.</p>
<p>Gmail is designed so employees can spend less time managing their inboxes, and more time<br />
being productive. Time-saving features like message threading, message labels, fast<br />
message search and powerful spam filtering help employees work efficiently with high<br />
volumes of email.</p>
<h3>Mobile email, calendar and IM access</h3>
<p>With several options for accessing their information while on the go, employees can be<br />
productive with Google Apps even when they're not at their desks.</p>
<p>At no extra charge, Google Apps supports over-the-air mobile access on BlackBerry<br />
devices, the iPhone, Windows Mobile, Android and many less powerful phones.</p>
<h3>99.9% uptime reliability guarantee with synchronous replication</h3>
<p>We guarantee that Google Apps will be available at least 99.9% of the time, so your<br />
employees are more productive and so you can worry less about system downtime.**</p>
<p>With synchronous replication, your data and activity in Gmail, Google Calendar, Google<br />
Docs and Google Sites is simultaneously preserved in multiple secure data centers. If one<br />
data center is unable to serve your requests, the system is designed to instantly fall<br />
back to another data center that can serve your account with no interruption in service.</p>
<p>The Radicati Group found that Microsoft Exchange typically has 60 minutes of unplanned<br />
downtime per month. Google Apps customers typically experience less than 15 minutes of<br />
downtime per month.</p>
<h3>Information security and compliance</h3>
<p>When you trust your company's information to Google, you can be confident that your<br />
critical information is safe and secure.</p>
<p>Google's information security team, including some of the worldâ€™s foremost experts<br />
in information, application and network security, are focused on keeping your information<br />
safe. Google and many other customers trust this system with highly sensitive corporate<br />
data.</p>
<p>Businesses get these customizable security features with Google Apps:</p>
<ul class="alt">
<li>Custom spam and inbound mail filtering tools, powered by Postini, to complement<br />
powerful spam filters that automatically work with no up-front configuration.</li>
<li>Custom outbound mail filtering tools to prevent sensitive information from being<br />
distributed, powered by Postini.</li>
<li>Custom information sharing rules to determine how broadly employees are allowed to<br />
share with Google Docs, Google Calendar and Google Sites.</li>
<li>Custom password length requirements and visual strength indicators to help employees<br />
pick secure passwords.</li>
<li>Enforced SSL connections with Google Apps to ensure secure HTTPS access.</li>
<li>Optional email archiving, up to 10 years of retention.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Full administrative and data control</h3>
<p>Administrators can deeply customize Google Apps to meet their technical, branding and<br />
business requirements.</p>
<p>Integration options let you connect Google Apps to your existing IT infrastructure.</p>
<ul class="alt">
<li>Single sign-on API connects Google Apps to your existing authentication system.</li>
<li>User provisioning utility and API connect Google Apps to your existing user directory<br />
system.</li>
<li>Email routing and email gateway support let you run Google Apps alongside an existing<br />
email solution.</li>
<li>Email migration utility and API let you bring mail from your existing email solution<br />
into Google Apps.</li>
</ul>
<p>System branding and data ownership give Google Apps your look and feel, and ensures<br />
customer ownership of employee data.</p>
<ul class="alt">
<li>Custom user accounts on your compay's internet domain.</li>
<li>Custom logo and colors in the applications.</li>
<li>Contractual customer ownership of employee data.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Helpful 24/7 customer support</h3>
<p>Google Apps is highly reliable and easy to operate, but support is available for<br />
administrators should you need it.</p>
<p>Support options include:</p>
<ul class="alt">
<li>Phone support for critical issues</li>
<li>Email support</li>
<li>Self-service online support</li>
</ul>
<p>Google Apps also has a deep network of partners ready to help businesses with<br />
deployment, data migration, user training, system integration and custom application<br />
development.</p>
<p><cite>** The 99.9% uptime SLA for Google Apps is offered to organizations using Google<br />
Apps for Business, as described in the Google Apps for Business Terms of Service.</cite></p>
