<h2>Trade online safely &amp; securely</h2>
<p>In 2008 sales over the internet in the UK totalled over £222bn, up from £65bn in 2004 (source: statistics.gov.uk). With no signs of this growth slowing down, the need for businesses to be online trading securely has never been greater.</p>
<p>SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is the globally recognised standard for securely encrypting information being passed between a server and web browser. The SSL Certificates we offer are exactly the same as those being used by the leading online businesses and banks. Providing your users with essential peace of mind, SSL certificates signify you offer world-class data protection, increasing both trust and revenue. Websites with SSL certificates guarantee stringent security checks are in place to protect user’s private information, such as their bank details. </p>
<p>As a website owner, you can trade online safely in the knowledge that the SSL secure connection will make sure all important information is kept out of reach from prying eyes. Having an SSL certificate will keep your visitors coming back time and time again, safe in the knowledge you provide a secure service. </p>
