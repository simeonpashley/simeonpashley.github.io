<div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">"In the future, everyone will be world-famous for 15 minutes." - Andy Warhol, 1968</div>
<p>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">Time has become compressed, 15 minutes is a long time now. Move fast or get left behind.</div>
<p>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">The take away here is that everything has a much shorter lifetime now. Recognise that your job won't be for life, your game will be forgotten within 2 months of launch, 10hrs of gameplay is a lifetime, even the massive investment in a typically massively multiplayer online game will only last 3 years.&nbsp;</div>
<p>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">Things change rapidly and you need to be prepared with your next successful venture, always think ahead, always expect change, never be complacent.</div>
