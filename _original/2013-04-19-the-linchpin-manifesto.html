<p>I am an artist. · I take initiative · I do the work, not the job. · Without critics, there is no art. · <strong>I am a Linchpin. I am not easily replaced.</strong> · If it’s never been done before, even better. · The work is personal, too important to phone in. · The lizard brain is powerless in the face of art. · I make it happen. Every day. · <strong>Every interaction is an opportunity to make a connection.</strong> · The past is gone. It has no power. The future depends on choices I make now. · I own the means of production—the system isn’t as important as my contribution to it. · I see the essential truth unclouded by worldview, and that truth drives my decisions. · I lean into the work, not away from it. <strong>Trivial work doesn’t require leaning.</strong> · Busywork is too easy. Rule-breaking works better and is worth the effort. · Energy is contagious. The more I put in, the more the world gives back. · It doesn’t matter if I’m always right. It matters that <em><strong>I’m always moving</strong>.</em> · I raise the bar. I know yesterday’s innovation is today’s standard. · I will not be brainwashed into believing in the status quo. · <strong>Artists don’t care about credit. We care about change.</strong> · There is no resistance if I don’t allow it to defeat me. · I embrace a lack of structure to find a new path. · I am surprising. (And often surprised). · I donate energy and risk to the cause. · I turn charisma into leadership. · The work matters. · <strong>Go. Make something happen.</strong></p>
