<h3>Who is @simeonpashley?</h3>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-673" style="margin: 5px; border: 5px solid white;" title="Simeon At Game Bafta" src="assets/SimeonAtBafta.jpg" alt="" width="248" height="285" />Hi, Thanks for clicking through from <strong>Facebook</strong>, let me share a little about me and the site.</p>
<p>My name is Simeon Pashley and I'm the originator of pashley.org and @simeonpashley on twitter. I also have a <a href="http://www.pashley.org">personal web-site</a>, which is more like an online CV.</p>
<h4>My Blogs</h4>
<p>I started this blog about video game development in 2010 after I was made redundant and found myself with time on my hands whilst I was looking for a new job in games development.</p>
<p>I initially wanted to share what I've learned over the years of game development and help the myriad of developers out there, hopefully enabling them to gain more specific knowledge without the trial and error of game development.</p>
<p>It was important to me to setup a blog that could represent multiple people as I know there are a lot of people out there I can learn from and they often go unheard as they battle away on the latest &amp; greatest games. I wanted to give them a voice too.</p>
<p>I was soon overwhelmed by the power of social networks and I rapidly connected with many game developers out there in the real world, learning more and more as I interacted with more people.</p>
<p>Over the last few months I've really enjoyed writing articles, meeting people and trying to get people to contribute and share their knowledge.</p>
