<h2 style="padding-bottom: 15px;">Tips on choosing a domain name</h2>
<h3>Keep it short, keep it simple</h3>
<p>To find your site people need to be able to remember your address and easily type it into their browser. Aim to register the shortest name that your customers and visitors will associate with your website.</p>
<h3>co.uk, com, eu, net, org...?</h3>
<p>It is a good idea to register several similar domain names, particularly if you own a trademark for a certain name. If possible register the .co.uk, .com, .eu and .net. These are the most popular domain names and by registering all of them you can help to prevent cyber squatters and losing traffic. </p>
<h3>Consider common typos</h3>
<p>If you have a domain name that can easily by pluralised or miss-spelled consider registering those as well to stop traffic going elsewhere.</p>
<h3>Don't shell out large amounts of money</h3>
<p>Some companies still sell domain names for as much as &pound;100 per year. Make sure you are getting a good deal! </p>
<h3>Register your domain now!</h3>
<p>You must register as soon as possible, or risk getting stuck with "the-domain-name-that-no-one-wanted.net". You do not have to have a Webmaster or an ecommerce department or a web design consultant... you don't even need a web page. Simply search for your domain name and register it yourself. Simple!</p>
<h2>FAQs</h2>
<h4>How long will it take for my new domain name to become active?</h4>
<p>Domains are registered as soon as you order them, however it can take between 24 and 72 hours for a domain name to become visible on the Internet as each DNS updates its database of domain names..</p>
<h4>Can I buy a domain name, but not buy web hosting?</h4>
<p>Yes, you do not have to buy the web hosting when you buy a domain name. If you decide to add web hosting in the future you can easily upgrade with one of our feature rich hosting packages.</p>
<h4>Do I own the domain name?</h4>
<p>Yes - unlike some companies we always register the domain in your name or in your customer's name if you are working on someone's behalf.</p>
<h4>Can I transfer the domain at any time?</h4>
<p>Yes, you can, and we provide a control panel so that you can make these changes yourself at any time and that's all included in the price.</p>
<h4>Do I get a certificate of ownership for the domain I purchase?</h4>
<p>In the past Nominet issued certificates as confirmation of the contract that exists between Nominet and the registrant and this continued until August 2003. Paper certificates and reply Forms have now been replaced by an online system called Registrants Online.</p>
