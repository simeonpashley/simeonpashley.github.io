<h2>The control panel</h2>
<p>Our control panel makes managing your Dedicated Server a breeze. Some of the features we provide are...</p>

<tr>
<td width="85"><img src="assets/icon_reload.png" alt="Server Reboot" /></td>
<td>
<h3>Server Reboot</h3>
<p>You can reboot your server any time you like. Just visit the "Manage Dedicated Servers" area of your control panel and click the real time reboot option. This will perform a hardware reboot (power cycle the server).</p>
<p>            You should always try and do a proper software reboot if you can, but if you do need to perform a hardware reboot then you are in complete control of this feature 24x7x365.</p>

<h3>Add IP Addresses</h3>
<p>We setup one IP address as standard and you can add another for free by clicking the option in the "Manage Dedicated Servers" area of your control panel. If you need more IP addresses after that you can buy these for £12 each per year.</p>

<h2>Data centre</h2>
<p>Cutting edge technology puts you in front of the competition</p>

<td width="85"><img src="assets/icon_reload.png" alt="Power Supply &amp; Backup" /></td>
<td>
<h3>Power Supply &amp; Backup</h3>
<p>Each rack has two independent power feeds, fed from two diverse connections to the national grid.</p>
<p>                Should one or both of these feeds fail 4 x 300kVA Riello UPS (N+1) battery backup systems will cover immediate power requirements. All power to the cabinets is supplied via the UPS to maintain clean supply to the servers.</p>
<p>    If mains power is not restored within 10 seconds 3 x N+1 diesel powered generators will start providing full continuous power to the data centre.</p>
<p>    Spare fuel for the generators is stored on-site and contracts are in place with fuel companies to deliver continuous emergency fuel for a virtually unlimited amount of time.</p>

<td width="85"><img src="assets/icon_warning.png" alt="Fire Suppression" /></td>

<h3>Fire Suppression</h3>
<p>Fire protection is provided by the FM200 Fire Suppression System which fills the sealed data centre with gas to extinguish any fire quickly without the use of water and without damage to any equipment.</p>

<h3>Climate Control</h3>
<p>The data centre is fully climate controlled with N+1 Stultz DX Cybercool Air Conditioning Systems. The system monitors and controls the temperature and humidity levels.</p>
<p>            Drip sensors located below floor monitor for any leaks in the system. Cold air is forced underneath raised flooring into the bottom of each server rack, and vacuumed out of the top providing maximum cooling efficiency. The position of each server rack/apparatus is calculated by a dedicated deployment team to further optimise cooling efficiency.</p>

<h3>100% Cisco Gigabit Network</h3>
<p>Our network operates on industry-leading network equipment from Cisco Systems. All our switches and routers are developed by Cisco. Our network is based on 10 gigabit technology, which means that it runs at a speed of 10000 Mb per second - most web hosting networks are limited to much less.</p>
<p>Our network also utilises 100% CAT6 network cable, which contains four pairs of copper wire and, unlike CAT5, utilises all four pairs. CAT6 supports Gigabit (1000 Mbps) Ethernet and supports communications at more than twice the speed of CAT5e, which is the other popular standard for Gigabit Ethernet cabling.</p>

<td width="85"><img src="assets/icon_lan.png" alt="Connectivity" /></td>

<h3>Connectivity</h3>
<p>We operates a multi-homed network utilising BGP4 technology. Simply put, we have multiple connections to the Internet with different backbone providers, should any connection fail our other connections automatically take all the traffic. Not only does this mean that we are very unlikely to lose connectivity to the Internet, but it also means that traffic moving to and from our network can choose from a range of paths to get to its final destination. This means that we have been able to configure the network always to take the fastest paths.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>
<h4>What type of hardware do you use?</h4>
<p>All our servers are genuine Dell Servers. If you are comparing Heart Internet to other providers please be aware that many companies make "homemade" servers using home computer motherboards in fabricated boxes.</p>
<h4>What level of access do I have to my server?</h4>
<p>You will have full root or administrator privileges to manage and access your server.</p>
<h4>Is there any software installed on the server to help me configure it?</h4>
<p>Yes, if you have chosen our Linux CentOS installation then we automatically install WebMin. WebMin is a web based control panel that allows you to do system administration tasks such as configure Apache or setup users. If you want the easiest management possible then we would suggest you add cPanel to your server.</p>
<h4>I need to reboot my server, how can I arrange this?</h4>
<p>You can reboot your server any time you like. Just visit the "Manage Dedicated Servers" area of your control panel and click the real time reboot option.</p>
<h4>How much bandwidth do I get?</h4>
<p>Your server comes with a 10mb connection to the Internet (10240 Kbps), It's just like having your own leased line. You can transfer as much data as you like within your 10mb line. Don't get this confused with your broadband at home or work; you don't share your 10mb with anyone else. 10mb is a huge amount of bandwidth which can support a very busy website, it roughly translates to 2560 GB of bandwidth a month.</p>
<h4>Do you have any restrictions on what I can use my server for?</h4>
<p>No, as long as anything you do on the server abides with UK law then you are free to use the server for any purpose.</p>
<h4>Can I use my server to host videos, stream audio or store large backups?</h4>
<p>Yes, you can use your server for any purpose you need.</p>
<h4>Where will my server be located?</h4>
<p>Your server will be based in our UK Data Centre.</p>
<h4>Does the server run RAID disk mirroring?</h4>
<p>Yes, all our servers are setup with hardware level RAID mirroring. In the unlikely event of a disk failure this means your server will continue to operate normally. We will be notified of the disk failure and will replace the broken disk for you with no cost or impact to your data or service.</p>
