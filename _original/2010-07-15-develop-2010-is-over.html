<p><span style="font-size: 13.2px;">Well, it looks like Develop 2010 is over for this year (the clue is in the name) and the next event is <a href="http://www.gamescom.de/en/gamescom/home/index.php">Gamescom</a> in just over 4 weeks time. Just enough time to detox ready for the next wave of 'networking'. :)</span></p>
<p>I wonder if Paul the Psychic Octopus predicted the correct Develop Award winners? It looks like he's patrolling the Gamescom web-site too, so BEWARE!</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13.2px;">Stick with us during the break and don't go changing channels!</span></p>
