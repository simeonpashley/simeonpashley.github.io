<p>During my career to date, there have been a handful times when I’ve had to let work friends down without warning or explanation and suffer the consequences of that afterwards. I have frequently justified this as a business decision and the reality is that sometimes this is necessary due to governing state law or the obligation and responsibility to the business that comes with executive roles. I often don’t get the time to apologise or smooth things over as both parties move on to try and recover from the situation. Here’s an attempt to redress some of that.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>I have on rare occasions had my hand forced by “the business” and done things that every fibre in my body tells me is wrong. I have made those tough calls and negatively affected peoples lives, which I openly apologise for.</p>
<p>I think it can be tough for some people to understand why someone would do these things and I don’t entirely understand the reasons myself. Sometimes things just happen, for better or worse.</p>
<p>To balance this I’d like to offer that more recently I have “forgotten” to follow the correct procedure for dealing with discipline favouring a more personal approach that I find more successful and personable. I really think such things should be taken as advice rather than a strict rule set to beat people with. It seems very Victorian.</p>
<h3>Deep Cuts</h3>
<p>For me the hardest decisions have come when people approach with game pitches begging you to take it on but you know that it’s just rubbish and will never sell. However, you also know that they employ 30+ people and the business will go bankrupt if you don’t say “yes”. Rejecting it is the right thing to do but you can’t help worrying about all those people, and their families that are dependant on your decision.<br />
The toughest one was communicating a decision, that was ultimately made by someone much more senior than me, to not take on a project employing 80+ people despite having given assurances to the team that things were looking positive. Money was spent by the developer and I suspect hundreds of thousands committed to the project over the 6 months it took to get the decision. It’s collapse was unexpected and came without warning for myself and the team. I can only apologise and sympathise.</p>
<h3>My Name Is Simeon</h3>
<p>In the style of the TV program “My Name Is Earl” I would love to have the time and means to visit each person and apologise personally and try and make up. I doubt this will ever happen but I will take every opportunity I get.</p>
<h3>Epic Fail</h3>
<p>I have ultimately suffered too under the weight of all of these actions, paying dearly for the pressure and stress this all takes but it comes with the territory and I believe you have to expect this and find ways to deal with it or you’re setting yourself for an epic fail.<br />
I care about the people I work with and the games that we make together, it hurts to think about the handful of things that have happened.<br />
Apologies are in order and the ‘net gives me some way of communicating this back and I hope it reaches down the years.</p>
