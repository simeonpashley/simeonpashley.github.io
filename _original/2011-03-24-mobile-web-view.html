<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-673" title="iPhone view of Ring Alpha" src="assets/iphone_ra.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Mobile purchases and mobile web viewing are increasing every day and it's simply not good enough to expect users to view your regular site. iPhone, Android and tablet viewers expect custom built views.</p>
<p>Thankfully, all of our regular and content-managed websites <strong>take full advantage of the iPhone, iPad, Android and other devices</strong> with views and touch-based interfaces especially built to get the most out of them.</p>
<p>Our new elegant iPad specific view is a joy to behold and features large buttons, swipe gestures and much more.</p>
<p><strong>Can you afford not to have a mobile website?</strong> Especially a <strong>FREE</strong> version of your existing site?</p>

<p>Following are some pictures of this web design site running on iPhone and iPad, I'm sure you'll agree they look very impressive.<br />
