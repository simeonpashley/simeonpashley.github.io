<p>We believe that web hosting is more than just providing web space and FTP access. Our aim is to provide individuals and businesses with everything they need to express themselves on the internet, be that through an idea or selling goods and services. Whatever you want to create a website for, be it a small family photo album or a full powered data base driven ecommerce website, your choice of web host is essential.  The right web host will make the difference between a slow clunky site that has regular down time and a site that is always available and blisteringly fast!</p>

<h3>Platform</h3>
<p>We only use Dell servers in our web hosting platform. Our platform is designed to be highly redundant and all data is stored in network disk arrays.</p>
<p>Data is automatically synchronised between the arrays so that in the event of an array failing the remaining array continues to serve data to the servers with no downtime. Each array is also backed up each night to a separate backup cluster which is then written to tape and stored offsite.</td>

The data centre is protected by fire suppression, monitored by CCTV both externally and internally, has 24x7x365 onsite security and the building is surrounded by an 8ft perimeter fence.</td>
