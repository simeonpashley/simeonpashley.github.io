<p>Ring Alpha recently provide a <strong>server migration service</strong> for one of our ongoing clients, a <strong>mid-size eCommerce store</strong> with thousands of transactions going through every day. The requirement was to improve the performance and technical specification of their site ahead of Ring Alpha providing them with a new eCommerce solution. </p>
<p>Lets find out what we did...</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>After a number of discussions with our client, it was obvious the rapidly growing eCommerce business had grown out of their existing hosting company and were in need of a technical upgrade that could cope with their increasing number of customers.</p>
<h3>What's needed?</h3>
<p>Our first task was to <strong>evaluate what they would need</strong> out of a <strong>new server</strong> and <strong>new hosting company</strong> to enable their business to scale over the coming months.</p>
<h4>Discover the technical needs</h4>
<p>The evaluation task itself involved <strong>detailed analysis of how their existing server</strong> was currently performing at a low level to highlight areas that needed improving. We checked out the server loads on various areas and made our checklist.</p>
<p>The new technical spec was a <strong>massive leap forwards</strong> and critically included 4 times the amount of memory and new hard-drive configuration that improved the disk performance of 4 times too.</p>
<h4>Hosting Partners</h4>
<p>The next job was to make a <strong>shortlist of hosting providers</strong> that met all of the requirements, one of which was that it should be UK based and ideally local to the business.</p>
<h4>Recommendations</h4>
<p>We contacted our regular list of hosting partners, <strong>negotiated improved specifications and lower monthly costs</strong> before making our recommendation of 2 of them, which were a good match for this particular job.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p><strong>Our work has delivered an improved technical specification that meets the needs of the business, all at a reduced price.</strong></p>
<p>Our experience in working at a low level with server and network hardware, understanding the demands of the base level software like Apache and MySQL, the higher level loads of the eCommerce software matched with the needs of the business and their customers all rolled up into Ring Alpha being able to find a new server and hosting partner specific for this job.</p>
