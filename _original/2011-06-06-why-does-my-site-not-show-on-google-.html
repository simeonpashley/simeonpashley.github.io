<p>How do I get my site found on Google?<br />
The timescale that we would usually advise any website holder to wait to get found on Google would be usually anywhere between two weeks and three months but all of this depends on whether or not you are actually helping your website out. </p>
<p>There are many different techniques that we would suggest to speed up this progress. In order to understand how to “Optimise” your site you have to understand how Google is searching these Google Sites, the search is based mainly on content. We would suggest that in order to give your website a higher chance of being found, that you make the content that the website holds keyword heavy, use rich descriptive text and include whatever search terms you wish to be found under, make it specific to your area of work, your specialist skills but bear in mind what search terms the general public may use if they were looking for a business like yours. </p>
<p>When your content is complete it would be advisable to submit your site to Google, you can do this by going to www.google.com/addurl - this area allows you to submit your url(web address) to Google while adding comments(key terms/search terms).<br />
Other areas that you can improve your search status would be by adding “Metatags” to your website, this can be done,(not by the conventional way) but in order to submit title tags to your site, you can add extra text into your site description part of your website. When you set the website up your site description will only include one term(usually the name of your business) but you can add to this area by going to More Actions > Manage Site> General > Site Description. You can add extra key phrases here in order to improve the search value of your site. </p>
<p>We would always suggest that certain tracking tools are used to check the progress of your sites searchable status. Google Webmaster Tools is very useful in terms of telling you how compatible your website is with the search engines. Webmaster tools will produce what keywords your site should be found under and what links you have going to your site. Some of the keywords may not be relevant to how you want the Google Crawlers to find your site so in cases such as these it would be highly recommended to manipulate your content to update these results. Usually the first five keywords within these results will be the most relevant to your searchable status. </p>
<p>When registering for Webmaster Tools you will be required to verify your domain ownership it will give you four options to do this, you should choose the metatag option then copy the metatag and go to your site. Log into your site then select More Actions>Manage Site> General and there is an area titled Google Webmaster Tools verification where you are able to paste the metatag. In order to track the progress of your site you can register with Google Analytics which will produce statistics to show how many views you are getting. As before you will need to verify your domain ownership to do this, you will be given a long html code that you will be told to paste into your site, as all the Google sites settings are in the control panel you will be required to retrieve and copy the UA number. This can be pasted into your site background by going to More Actions>Manage Site>General and under the area that says “Enable Google Analytics” there is a suitable box with an example of what a UA number looks like (UA-12345-12). </p>
<p>Finally the last suggestion that we give to help your site be found is through link building, you can do this by using online directories or free advertising tools. This method helps your content and business be found in different areas and communities. It also helps push more traffic towards your website. Some sites we would recommend that you link with are: </p>
<p>www.bttradespace.com<br />
www.linkedin.com<br />
www.business-directory-uk.co.uk<br />
www.facebook.com<br />
www.twitter.com </p>
<p>These are free and easy websites to use and it will help your business get noticed and pass more traffic to your site, also we would also recommend that you should do a Google search for “Free Online Advertising” which will produce 100s of free advertising sites that you can also advertise your business and web address on.<br />
