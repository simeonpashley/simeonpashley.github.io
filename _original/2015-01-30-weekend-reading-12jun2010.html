<p>As the editor of @simeonpashley I love to hear from you and share the brilliant things I find from other game development linchpins I discover.</p>
<p>I've recently updated the site <a href="/book-shelf">book shelf</a> with books I recently discovered from an amazing computer graphic artist Simeon used to work with, Antony Ward.<br />
<!--more--><br />
His work appears has appeared in many games over the years and always looks amazing. His books are in the <a href="http://astore.amazon.co.uk/gamedevelcons-21?_encoding=UTF8&node=6">Authors I Know</a> section and well worth a read if you're into discovering how to start and improve your high-end character art. I'm not an artist myself but I think that Antony's work clearly shows that he really knows what he's doing and produces some amazing art.</p>
<p>You can view more of Antony's computer graphic work via his online blog & portfolio<br />
<a href="http://www.ant-online.co.uk/">http://www.ant-online.co.uk/</a></p>
<p>Or contact him via twitter @ant_ward or his tips section @3dtwips</p>
<p class="alert">I also look forward to learning from you too via comments, <a rel="nofollow" href="/contact">feedback</a> and having <a rel="nofollow" href="/write-for-us">your articles</a> appear here.</p>
