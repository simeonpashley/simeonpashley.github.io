<p>If you're interested in sponsoring/advertising on pashley.org the following guide should give you all the information required.</p>
<h3>Criteria</h3>
<p>pashley.org is looking to select sponsors who's presence will benefit our membership. All advertisers should be able to demonstrate that they have high standards and are related to Freelancing / Contracting within the Video Games industry.</p>
<h3>Standard Advertiser</h3>
<p>Branding is permitted in usernames and signatures for both of the above options.</p>
<p>As an addition, real-time advertising statistics on links and banners are available for viewing. We can also distribute an automated report on a weekly/monthly basis if required.</p>
<p>Banners must be provided by the customer (acceptable specifications will be provided). We do have some industry contacts if you require a banner designing at additional cost.</p>
<h3>Acceptance Process</h3>
<p>It has become apparent that perception of the sponsors on pashley.org is extremely important to the members, almost to the point that the membership feel that being able to sponsor/advertise on pashley.org is a seal of approval for companies. Whilst not strictly true, we feel this can only be a good thing, and is why we have decided to introduce a written acceptance policy.</p>
<p>Your posts there are confidential with only you and the moderation team able to view your request. It is advisable to submit as much information about the business as possible to speed the process. Please also include contact details. Your request will then be placed in a private staging area where the entire team will discuss it for suitability, based on the Criteria outlined below. Once a decision has been made, you will be notified of pricing, payment options and the terms of the agreement. Sponsorship/advertising will only commence once full payment has been made for the selected sponsorship term.</p>
<h3>Termination</h3>
<p>pashley.org reserves the right to terminate the sponsorship/advertising at any time without notice. Examples of this could be consistently bad service, pashley.org member complaints, quality, and general behaviour. This is obviously not an exhaustive list and each case will be considered individually.</p>
<p>On termination any monies paid in advanced will be refunded.</p>
<p>Kind Regards,<br />
pashley.org Team</p>
