<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 13px;"></span><br />The way we apply for roles is still baked into the tradition of a paper CV along with the formatting that goes with it. Stop, think about it.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />Imagine your Resume sat in a pile with the recruiter shuffling through them at high speed, what makes your CV stand out? Do you get your key message across in the 1st few lines?</p>
<p>Does the recruiter need to know your address and education first? Do we care about what you did 10 years ago? What are you offering? How do you fit the role you're applying for? Does it communicate you?</p>
<div>If you're an artist or designer, show your creativity in your CV.</p>
<p>Remember, if you're CV passes through an agency they will inevitably strip it of all of your contact information and ultimately re-format it.</p></div>
