<h3>Keywords research </h3>
<p>The most important task of search engine optimization, and by far the trickiest and the hardest to accomplish is finding the right keywords (search phrases). With this plan, our marketing professionals will review your website and will come up with a list of keywords that are the most effective for your website. Each of the keywords is chosen very carefully using the following procedure:</p>
<p><strong>Targeting</strong> - The keyword must reflect your exact product and service offerings, your geographical availability and your desired audience, so that it will drive to your website such customers that you will be able covert into buyers.</p>
<p><strong>Popularity</strong> - The keyword must be used by search engines users, as there is no point in using a keyword that nobody is searching for. We will actually provide you with the exact numbers of how many times people searched for your keywords and their variations last month in the top search engines!</p>
<p><strong>Competition</strong> - The keyword must pass our competitive analysis test, which includes a competitive analysis on each specific keyword in conjunction with your website and your competitors' websites. Our marketing professional run this test using our unique innovative technology.</p>

<h3>Ranking performance </h3>
<p>We will provide you with a detailed report of how your website performs in the top search engines. We will crawl 100 results within each of the search engines, for each of your keywords, saving you hours of work. The ranking report will provide the following information about your site:</p>
<p><strong>Ranking Position</strong> - This is the first position found for the website according to the selected keyword, and the most likely to be clicked by the user.</p>
<p><strong>Ranking Page Number</strong> - As search engines display different amounts of results when a search is performed, we display the page number that the first result is found on. You may be number 35 on Yahoo, but that is still on the second result page, not the fourth.</p>
<p><strong>URL Count</strong> - This is the number of times the search engine finds a listing for your website within its indices. For some engines, the more times you are listed, the better your chances of showing well.</p>

<h3>Link popularity</h3>
<p>Link popularity is a display of the number of times the search engine has a reference of other websites linking to yours. This can have an impact on your position in some search engines. When other websites list a link to yours, some engines find that to mean your site is more valuable and increase the possibility of you showing well. For those engines that provide this information, the higher the number the better.</p>
