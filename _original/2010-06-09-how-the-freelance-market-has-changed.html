<p>An interesting <a href="http://www.freelanceadvisor.co.uk/employment-advice/how-the-freelance-economy-is-changing/">article over on Freelance Advisor</a> confirms how the global market is changing, here’s how it opens, with more detail to follow:</p>
<blockquote><p>The freelance economy is going through a phase of radical growth and transformation. We explore some of the more fundamental trends and shifts utilizing data and survey results published by <a href="http://www.peopleperhour.com/">PeoplePerHour.com</a> – the largest marketplace for freelancers and small businesses in Europe with over 64,000 registered users in over 150 countries</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The article quotes lots of positive information and includes:</p>
<blockquote><p>The freelance way of working has proved itself as an established, long-term trend and not just a recessionary fad as thought by many. Virtual working is now part of the DNA of start-ups, setting themselves up from the get-go as virtual set-ups with a distributed workforce of freelance talent across the world. These are as important as their in house team and indeed in many cases as permanent. Deploying freelancers is shifting from the ad hoc cost-slashing solution to the de facto way of doing things. And naturally quality takes precedence. </p>
<p>Currently: </p>
<ul>
<li>Only 7% of jobs are awarded to the lowest bidder </li>
<li>88% are awarded to freelancers with the highest feedback </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I find this encouraging and I can see how it’s becoming more &amp; more of a requirement for computer games as working with outsource, freelance or contractors provides a solution to the problems of down-time, flexibility and getting the best person for the job.</p>
<p>The Freelance Advisor web-site always has interesting articles that are particularly focused on UK freelancers so it’s worth adding it to your list of subscriptions.</p>
