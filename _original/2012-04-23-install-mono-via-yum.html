<h2>Install mono via YUM</h2>
<p>yum -y install mono-*</p>
<p>yum -y install httpd-devel</p>
<p>Install mod_mono from source</p>
<h2>yum install mono-addon-xsp</h2>
<h2>mono -V</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What's really wrong</h2>
<p>Since day one i'd been receiving warnings at apache startup up, but since i didn't understand what they meant and things seemed to be working, i had been ignoring the,. Of course, <em>that was a lie on its face</em>. Things were clearly not working, with the leaking semaphores, but I conveniently filed the two issues as unrelated in my head and ignored them at my peril. The warning was this:</p>
<pre>[Mon Jan 24 00:12:50 2011] [crit] The unix daemon module not initialized yet.
Please make sure that your mod_mono module is loaded after the User/Group
directives have been parsed. Not initializing the dashboard.</pre>
<p>This warning was repeated for as many times as I had ASP.NET vhosts defined. I looked at my vhost configurations and saw nothing about users and groups and thought it was some weird mono issue and left it at that. But <strong>the actual problem was not in the vhost configuration but in httpd.conf</strong>. The problem was this default section:</p>
<pre>#
# Load config files from the config directory "/etc/httpd/conf.d".
#
Include conf.d/*.conf

#
# If you wish httpd to run as a different user or group, you must run
# httpd as root initially and it will switch.
#
# User/Group: The name (or #number) of the user/group to run httpd as.
#  . On SCO (ODT 3) use "User nouser" and "Group nogroup".
#  . On HPUX you may not be able to use shared memory as nobody, and the
#    suggested workaround is to create a user www and use that user.
#  NOTE that some kernels refuse to setgid(Group) or semctl(IPC_SET)
#  when the value of (unsigned)Group is above 60000;
#  don't use Group #-1 on these systems!
#
User apache
Group apache</pre>
<p>Obviously User and Group are set after all vhost configs are loaded. Pretty much exactly what the warning was saying (<em>doh</em>). I simply moved the Include below User/Group and since then I have not seen more than 9 semaphores and I've restarted mono, rebuilt the application and hit the app with ApacheBench, the combination of which used to drive semaphores up.</p>
<p>Since things are working now and ASP.NET MVC under mod_mono is significantly faster than the Rails port, I'm sticking with ASP.NET MVC for production right now, monitoring semaphores to make sure this really did fix the problem.</p>
