<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-675" title="Google Products" src="assets/google_products.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Are your products listed on Google Shopping?</strong> If not, why not? Does your existing Google Merchant / Froogle / Base feed meet the new required format?</p>
<p>Getting your products listed under Google Shopping is easy to do and <strong>bring buying customers straight to your products</strong> with the great side-effect is that your products can <strong>appear on the 1st page of Search Results</strong> bypassing your competitors!<br />
<!--more--><br />
The great news continues - many <strong>price comparison web-sites use Google Shopping</strong> for their price information so your products start to appear around the web strengthening your chances of getting more customers.</p>
<p>Applications such as '<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/redlaser/id312720263?mt=8">Red Laser</a>' for iPhone make it easy for mobile customers to <strong>find your products simply by scanning bar codes</strong> with the phone camera while they're out shopping. (this requires barcodes/UPC/EAN/ISBN data for your products)</p>
<p><strong>We have now placed thousands of products on the Google Shopping, and they are generating business for our clients.</strong></p>
<p>We have successfully adapted existing websites to support the new Google Merchant format enabling older sites to get the benefits of comparison shopping without a complete site replacement.</p>
<p><strong>Can your business afford to miss out?</strong></p>
<p>We can adapt your existing online store to automatically send your products to Google Shopping and get listed, <a href="/contact">contact us</a>TODAY to find out how.</p>
