<h2>Call for contenders – 20/5</h2>
<p>With all the online services available for hosting personal blogs, photos, and other aspects of your digital persona, there's still something very refreshing about hosting your own stuff. This week we want to hear about your favourite personal web host. </p>

<p>Not everyone needs a massive server plan and an equally massive bill. This week we want to hear all about how you host your web site economically and which personal web host has won you over with their great prices, features, customer service, or all of the above. The focus of this Hive is on<strong>personal web hosts</strong>. While you might love the web host that provides hosting for your entire company, if they don't offer small and affordable personal plans for individuals, they're not what we're looking for in this Hive Five. </p>
<p>Hive Five nominations take place in the comments, where you post your favorite tool for the job. We get hundreds of comments, so to make your nomination clear, please include it at the top of your comment like so: <strong>VOTE: Best Personal Web Host</strong>. Please don't include your vote in a reply to another commenter. Instead, make your vote and reply separate comments. If you don't follow this format, we may not count your vote. To prevent tampering with the results, votes from first-time commenters may not be counted. After you've made your nomination, let us know what makes it stand out from the competition. </p>
<p><em>About the Hive Five:</em> The Hive Five feature series asks readers to answer the most frequently asked question we get: &quot;Which tool is the best?&quot; Once a week we'll put out a call for contenders looking for the best solution to a certain problem, then YOU tell us your favorite tools to get the job done. Every weekend, we'll report back with the top five recommendations and give you a chance to vote on which is best. For an example, check out last week's <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5540019/five-best-bookmark-management-tools">Hive Five Best Bookmark Management Tools</a>. </p>
