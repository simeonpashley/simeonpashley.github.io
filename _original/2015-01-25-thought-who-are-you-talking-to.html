<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 13px;">Remember, you're always talking to your game players, the end audience. You're not talking to the middle-man, the Interviewer, Lead Designer, Journalist or your Manager. Think about who it is you're really addressing.</span></p>
