<h3>How and Why I use Social Networks such as LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter. A Social Networking Policy</h3>
<p>My policy helps me manage the expectations of my network. When everyone knows what to expect, they won’t be upset if, for example, I connect with them on LinkedIn, but haven’t “friended” them on Facebook.</p>
<p>To keep things simple, I’ve placed my policy in chart form for easy reference. I also have a more detailed Twitter Policy (bottom) as I use Twitter the most and feel it requires specifics.</p>
<p>Feel free to contact me as stipulated on the appropriate network. I also appreciate feedback, so please leave a comment on my blog. It encourages conversation not only between both of us, but by other visitors.</p>

<p>I also maintain a presence on a few other services, but as I am not active I will leave details for a later time.</p>
<h3>TWITTER FOLLOWING POLICY</h3>
<p>This Following Policy is specifically for Twitter and was established so that my Followers can clearly understand why I may or may not follow them back, and how quickly they can expect me to start following. To be sure, this is not my entire process. When I learn that someone is following me I usually do things like look at their Profile page, review some of their comments and Favorites, and look at who they follow and who is following them, etc.</p>
<p>I highly recommend that all Twitter users adopt policies of their own. I believe it will help reduce churn and make Twittering a better experience for all.</p>
