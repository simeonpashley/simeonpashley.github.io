<p>One of the hardest parts of creating a web page, poster, or company memo has to do with finding free, relevant pictures to accompany the text. One simple solution would be to design ones own artwork, instead of searching for it; unfortunately, many individuals are illiterate when it comes to graphical skills. Another relatively easy solution is to head over to Google images, type in our search criteria, and download the first available image. The problem here is that you have no idea as to the imageâ€™s copyright status. Downloading and using a commercial image on your public website can potentially get you into a bit of trouble.</p>
<p>Luckily, there is a viable solution: sites which specialize in providing public domain clip art images. At this point, you may be wondering what public domain means. Basically, if something is in the public domain, it is both free to use and requires no form of attribution (in other words, you can use it without giving credit to its author). And since no attribution is required, you are free to use and manipulate the images any way you like for whatever purpose you choose. Two of the largest, and most respectable public domain clip art sites are <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.openclipart.org/"> openclipart.org</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.clker.com/">clker.com</a>.</p>
<p>Openclipart is a huge repository of clip art images, all which have been placed in the public domain by their respective authors. At Openclipart you can either traverse through the images individually or download the complete pack (some 26,000 images weighing in at approximately 500 MB). Each image is generally available in both the png file format (which can be opened by almost any graphics program or word processor) and the svg file format (which is used by professional illustrators).</p>
<p>Clker, like Openclipart, is also a huge repository of clip art images. The great thing about clker is that images are actually organized according to categories; therefore, it is fairly easy to find just the picture you are looking for. And just like Openclipart, Clker provides these images in both png and svg file formats.</p>
<p>The best thing about both of these sites is that they have been around for quite some time and have a large following. As a result, there are always new pictures coming in. Furthermore, you can feel confident that these images are, indeed, in the public domain.</p>
