<p>Hmmm…. this could be a tough one to work out. Imagine all of the power used; development hardware like PCs, food eaten, servers, travel for business and commuting, air-conditioning, manufacturing of the discs, manuals the list goes on and on. Don’t forget everything at the publisher too. A killer title like God Of War 3, Modern Warfare 2 or Dead Redemption must have an astronomical footprint!</p>
<p>Has anyone made a carbon neutral game? Wouldn’t that be a great USP for your game? Who will be the 1st?</p>
