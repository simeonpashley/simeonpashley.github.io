<p>By special request I'm going to dig deep and put together a series of posts on <strong>Video Game Production</strong>, covering the whole cycle from end-to-end to hopefully share some of the knowledge I've acquired over the years and get your feedback too on what you think. This will include elements from numerous training courses and also hard-earned best practice learned from doing the job and working with amazing people.</p>
