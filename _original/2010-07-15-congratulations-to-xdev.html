Well, I wished I'd been at the Develop awards for a few reasons....</p>
<p><!--more-->Firstly, I'm really happy that the team I worked with and projects I worked on through 2008 to 2010 received 2 awards:<br />
a) <strong>XDev</strong> (Sony Computer Entertainment External Development) won a Business Development award.<br />
b) <strong>Quantic Dream</strong> (developer of Heavy Rain via XDev) won best Independent Studio</p>
<p>The team up at XDev are an awesome set of guys and I can honestly say that all of the games they touch are infinitely better for it. They work hard behind the scenes wrangling projects and weaving magic with the seemingly infinite array of internal departments.</p>
<p>Not unsurprisingly the games often get awards, the developers sometimes get recognition, XDev as a studio rarely does and the individuals never do, which is a shame.</p>
<p>Without them you wouldn't have the likes of Heavy Rain, Little Big Planet, Killzone, Buzz, Super Stardust and a bewildering array of other games.</p>
<p>I'd like to express some personal thanks to (in no particular order): Scott, Ray, Lee, Ste, MarkO, Phil, Simon, Sam, Rob, JP, Pete, John. <em>There are more people there but these are the people I worked closest with.</em></p>
<h1 style="text-align: center;">Congratulations!</h1>
