I"×'<p>Iâ€™ve been meaning to re-present something I did for a whole game
development studio a while back about â€˜<strong>Flow</strong>â€™. It instantly improved
production and was something we held dear as a team.</p>

<p>Have you ever said anything
like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>â€œWow, is it that time already?â€</li>
  <li>â€œSorry, I was miles awayâ€</li>
  <li>â€œI get my best work done when everyoneâ€™s gone home!â€</li>
</ul>

<p>If the answer is yes, then youâ€™ve experienced a state of <strong>Flow</strong> and
most likely been incredibly productive. Itâ€™s sometimes called being â€œin
the zoneâ€ too among others. Hereâ€™s my take on a well-known psychological
state and why itâ€™s important to game developers.</p>

<p>FlowÂ is a highly productive state of mind, time slips by and you blitz
through work, making fewer mistakes, no thought about how much effort
your making and generally higher quality thinking goes into it too.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œFlow isÂ a condition ofÂ deep, nearly meditative involvement. In this
state, there is a gentle sense of euphoria, and one is largely unaware
of the passage of time.â€ DeMarco.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Iâ€™ve been a long time supporter of enabling people to enter this state
of <strong>Flow</strong> and stay there so they can do their best work and enjoy it.
Itâ€™s important for managers, colleagues, producers and businesses to
recognise that supporting this can make a real difference to the quality
of your game.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/FlowTarget.png" alt="FlowTarget" title="FlowTarget" />As you settle in for a
good working session, you slip from your Regular un-productive state
that you sit at your desk at, through your <strong>Immersion</strong> phase into a
state of <strong>Flow</strong> and this whole process typically takes you about 15
minutes to get through, although it can vary from person to person.</p>

<p><strong>Interruptions</strong></p>

<p>Weâ€™veÂ recognised that the state of <strong>Flow</strong> is important and that it
typically takes you <strong>15 minutes</strong> to get there. The problem here is
that there are many distractions and interruptions that break your
concentration and send you crashing back up through the layers to
reality.</p>

<p>These interruptions mean youâ€™re now back to the start and itâ€™s going to
take you yet another 15 minutes to get back down there and if youâ€™d only
just got there then it was also a waste of your last immersion. Thatâ€™s
15 minutes lost for every interruption you get. This can be incredibly
frustrating and it drives me insane!</p>

<p>Imagine a horrible state weâ€™re youâ€™re constantly interrupted and never
get into <strong>Flow</strong>.</p>

<h4 id="explicit-interruptions">Explicit Interruptions</h4>

<p><img src="/assets/img/800serviceinterruptiontransfer.jpg" alt="800-service-interruption-transfer" title="800-service-interruption-transfer" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>You get an email pop-up â€“ +15 minutes</li>
  <li>IM pops up â€“ +15 minutes</li>
  <li>Telephone call â€“ +15 minutes</li>
  <li>At desk requests - +15 minutes</li>
  <li>â€˜pingâ€™ from a new text message on your mobile - +15 minutes</li>
  <li>Starting a long build â€“ +15 minutes</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="implicit-interruptions">Implicit Interruptions</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Noise</li>
  <li>Interrupting colleagues â€“ how often does your neighbours phone go
off?</li>
</ul>

<p>You can quickly see how this can mount up to a problem and in a bigger
team the problem compounds itself as the people who have been
interrupted start sending emails, pop around to someone for a chat, ask
if you want to join them for a coffee, etc.</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s also a consideration for time of day too as if itâ€™s close to
your break/lunch/home time then youâ€™re most likely to just not bother
trying to get back</p>

<p>I had a particular problem when I was running a team and sitting among
them. I often had to use the phone to make or receive business calls. I
rapidly became aware that every time I did that people stopped working
to listen to what I was saying and I was obviously disturbing them. They
werenâ€™t cross, they were just interested in what I was talking about and
often asked questions. I intended this to be transparency but I was
causing a whole load of drag on peopleâ€™s time.</p>

<p>Youâ€™ll also see this happen when you approach to ask someone a question
and the others around them drift out so they can pay attention.</p>

<h3 id="mitigating-interruptions">Mitigating Interruptions</h3>

<p>Here are a few things you can do to try to help
yourself:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Turn communications systems off</strong> and let everyone know why youâ€™re
doing it; E-Mail, IM and Phone. Itâ€™s not going to be forever and Iâ€™m
sure your manager/lead will be happy you want to be focused.</li>
  <li>Use your email apps <strong>Out Of Office system to auto-respond</strong> letting
people youâ€™ll get back to them soon. This prevents them from
thinking youâ€™re ignoring them for no reason.</li>
  <li>Set your email app to <strong>only check emails every 30 mins</strong> or so. Do
emails really need an instantaneous response?</li>
  <li><strong>â€˜Zebraâ€™ Mail</strong> - Iâ€™ve also used the email apps rules systems to
pickup keywords in the subject line to bring an alert up. In my
example people knew that putting the word â€˜Zebraâ€™ in the subject
line would mean it would get my instant attention. I could also
change the word to prevent people just using it all of the time.</li>
  <li><strong>Put your headphones on.</strong> This seems to be the international
symbol for Do Not Disturb plus youâ€™ve got a damn good excuse for not
responding to general chat as you canâ€™t hear them! You donâ€™t have to
listen to music either, just pop your headphones on.</li>
  <li><strong>Door Etiquette</strong> - If youâ€™re fortunate to have your own office
then adopt a door protocol such
as: - Door Open - ready for interruption - Door ajar - priority interruptions only - Door closed - Do Not Disturb on pain of death</li>
</ul>

<p>Consider other peopleâ€™s desire to be undisturbed, do you really need an
answer to that question now?Â  Try and use appropriate
communication:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Time critical</strong>: voice</li>
  <li><strong>Immediate &amp; discreet</strong>: Instant Message</li>
  <li><strong>Can wait</strong>: e-mail</li>
</ul>

<p>Teams and Studios should support this whole way of working by being
considerate and enabling people to work for extended periods in an
undisturbed state.</p>

<h3 id="how-long-to-stay-in-flow--exceptions">How long to stay in Flow &amp; Exceptions</h3>

<p>In our game development world there are typically 2
camps: Developers and Managers.</p>

<p><strong>Developers generally need to stay focused for 2 hrs</strong> to get anything
meaningful done and make progress. Iâ€™ve rarely seen anything take less
than this and staying focused for more than that is difficult.</p>

<p><strong>Managers are exceptions</strong> as they typically work in 20 min batches if
theyâ€™re lucky. Their job requires constant monitoring and attention to
others and they need to use email, phone and IM to communicate
throughout the studio.</p>

<p>People in a Lead role are caught between the two roles as they are often
asked to both Develop and Manage. In this position they need time to do
the work but theyâ€™re constantly interrupted and this often leads to a
sense of immense frustration. I often see Leads spending the regular
working hours being interrupted and attending meetings but staying late
to do their work. Itâ€™s a tough place to be and the only advice I can
give is to try to <strong>time-box your availability</strong> so people know which
hat youâ€™re wearing at any point in time.</p>

<h3 id="consequences">Consequences</h3>

<p>There are natural consequences of not considering Flow.</p>

<p>Being mindful of it and actively supporting it improves efficiency,
quality of work and aids progression. All of which make for happier
Developers and a better game.</p>

<p>The natural opposite of this in a world where interruptions are rife and
people canâ€™t work are poor performance, poor quality of work and most
likely late delivery.</p>

<p>We all know that the work still needs doing so in the latter example,
people end up working overtime to compensate. This overtime usually
occurs when all the interruptions are gone so people get work done.</p>

<p>Strive to keep a working environment that enables people to <strong>Flow</strong> as
often as possible.</p>

<h3 id="meta-flow">Meta-Flow</h3>

<p>In addition to the regular working flow I also believe thereâ€™s a concept
of Meta Flow if we take the principles of having a continuous and
focused train of thought about a particular subject over an extended
period.</p>

<p>This comes in to play when youâ€™re team members are working on a
particular item for an extended period of days, even weeks. Their mind
is full of a single task and shouldnâ€™t be polluted or interrupted by
other things occurring. Think of a physics programmer being pulled off
to do work on the rendering system only to return back to physics a
short while later. In this scenario it makes sense for them to
consecutively focus on Physics.</p>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>

<p>Being aware of, honouring and supporting <strong>Flow</strong> can make a real
difference to your game development team and therefore the game.
Encourage everyone in your organisation to learn about it and respect
it.</p>
