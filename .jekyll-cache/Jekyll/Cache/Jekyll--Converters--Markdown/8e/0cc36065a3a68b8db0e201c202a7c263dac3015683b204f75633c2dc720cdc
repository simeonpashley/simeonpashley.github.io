I"Ä<p>As the editor of @simeonpashley I love to hear from you and share the
brilliant things I find from other game development linchpins I
discover.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve recently updated the site <a href="/book-shelf">book shelf</a> with books I
recently discovered from an amazing computer graphic artist Simeon used
to work with, Antony Ward.</p>

<p>His work appears has appeared in many games over the years and always
looks amazing. His books are in the <a href="http://astore.amazon.co.uk/gamedevelcons-21?_encoding=UTF8&amp;node=6">Authors I
Know</a> section and well worth a read if youâ€™re into discovering how to start and improve your high-end character art. Iâ€™m not an artist myself but I think that Antonyâ€™s work clearly shows that he really knows what heâ€™s doing and produces some amazing art.</p>

<p>You can view more of Antonyâ€™s computer graphic work via his online blog
&amp; portfolio <a href="http://www.ant-online.co.uk/">http://www.ant-online.co.uk/</a></p>

<p>Or contact him via twitter @ant_ward or his tips section @3dtwips</p>

<p>I also look forward to learning from you too via comments,
<a href="/contact">feedback</a> and having <a href="/write-for-us">your articles</a> appear
here.</p>
