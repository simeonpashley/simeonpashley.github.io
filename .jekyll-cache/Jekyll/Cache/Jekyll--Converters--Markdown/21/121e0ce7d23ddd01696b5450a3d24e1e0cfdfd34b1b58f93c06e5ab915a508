I"ı<p>Iâ€™ve been fortunate recently to take a break from video game development
and really focus on what the next exciting stage of my career is going
to be. Â I was overseas for a week recently in a remote area of Spain and
I was taken away from the ubiquitous 24/7/365 connectivity with the
world that we find ourselves part of everyday whilst trying to devote
ourselves to video games. Back home internet access has become as
important is breathing: wifi hotspots, fast data over 3G, netbooks and the iPhone mean that youâ€™re only ever seconds away from a rich world of
content. Strip this away and you can really escape the noise and focus.</p>

<h3 id="rare-internet">Rare Internet</h3>

<p>Whilst away, connecting took a lot of effort, I had to head out quite a
distance and find an open WiFi spot to hang off and connect with the
outside world. At the time I had a lot of important things to do and I
couldnâ€™t afford to be disconnected for even 24hrs and I didnâ€™t have the
luxury of a paid expense account to fund expensive roaming data.</p>

<h3 id="the-upside">The Upside</h3>

<p>There was a pleasant side-effect brought about by a lack of noise from
the internet: time connected had to be purposeful and focused and there was no time for lazy searching and going off on tangents. Check email, check the blog, answer questions, check social networks, cache
information, done.</p>

<p>The natural implication is that it allowed for plenty of time for
reading, thinking and preparing without a barrage of interrupting calls,
emails, status updates and tweets. Things we deem necessary in the 21st
century.</p>

<h4 id="filtering-the-flow-of-information">Filtering Â the flow of information</h4>

<p>Iâ€™ve always tried to control the flow to a degree, I would confess that
back home I purposefully stem the flow of information in a few ways or
thereâ€™s just no time for work, we all need time to breath and think
about whatâ€™s going on or weâ€™re just
reacting:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a) E-Mail only syncs every 30mins (or when I send). This can seem like a
lifetime but it means youâ€™ve got some time to work. If someone wants
something urgently then theyâ€™ll call.</li>
  <li>b) Phone calls - this is a bit controversial but I occasionally let a
call go to voice mail in order to figure out if I think itâ€™s important
to interrupt what Iâ€™m doing. I imagine the person standing next to me
and wonder if theyâ€™d interrupt if they could actually see what I was
doing at that moment. The exception here is my family and people I work
for, who always get priority.</li>
  <li>c) Social Networks - I check my personal once daily, and my business
ones a lot more frequently than that, as they are by definition,
business related and therefore an opportunity may be lurking.</li>
</ul>

<p>I think itâ€™s true to say that we only rarely do things require a
response within seconds, certainly not if the correct considered answer
is required.</p>

<h3 id="liberating">Liberating</h3>

<p>Iâ€™d easily use the word â€œliberatingâ€ to describe the disconnection and
having this space (or slack) is something I think we all need in order
to do our best work. Itâ€™s a luxury but itâ€™s nice to be reminded of what
itâ€™s like to be un-interrupted from time-to-time but Iâ€™m glad to be
plugged back in.</p>
