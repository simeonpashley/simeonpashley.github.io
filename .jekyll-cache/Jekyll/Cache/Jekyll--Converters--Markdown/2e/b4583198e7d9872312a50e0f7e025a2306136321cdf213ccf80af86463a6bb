I"˝<p>Connecting with your audience is absolutely critical to the success of
your game and is something you should take seriously and adopt a
professional understanding. I‚Äôll cover some of the high level points
here and provide how to maximise social media communication for different business types.</p>

<h2 id="old-skool--new-skool">Old Skool / New Skool</h2>

<h3 id="forums--old-skool">Forums ‚Äì old skool</h3>

<p>The old style way of interacting with ‚Äúconsumers‚Äù was to wait for them
to discover some forums you had lurking around somewhere, on a
discretely hosted web-site hoping they stumbled across them. Such forums
still have a valuable role and can gain some feedback that you really
need to know. A certain amount of ‚Äúknow how‚Äù is required to use the
forums as registration is often required and users have to build up an
internal reputation. The big bonus is they typically contain dedicated
gamers used to giving feedback.</p>

<h3 id="social-media--new-skool">Social Media ‚Äì new skool</h3>

<p>The more modern way is to go to your audience on social media sites and
connect there. Good examples include [blippr]Facebook[/blippr] Fan pages
and [blippr]Twitter[/blippr] streams where people are likely to be
sharing feedback about your game anyway and you need to be there,
especially if you‚Äôre doing <strong>Minimum Viable Product</strong> production and
need to iterate your game.</p>

<h2 id="facebook">Facebook</h2>

<p>Make it easy for people to ‚ÄòLike‚Äô your game on
<a href="http://www.facebook.com" title="Facebook">Facebook</a>, which also posts on their wall and tells their friends too, and encourage conversation by using the discussion areas on the Facebook Fan page. It isn‚Äôt enough to just setup the Fan page and expect people to just turn up, it takes
effort. I would discourage you from setting up a Facebook ‚ÄòPage‚Äô as
these feel very business like as they don‚Äôt currently incorporate much
in the way of community.</p>

<h2 id="twitter">Twitter</h2>

<p><strong><a href="http://twitter.com" title="Twitter">Twitter</a></strong> is also an amazingly
powerful, and yet simple, tool for interacting with the community around
your game. There‚Äôs a deep vein of gold to be mined here as your
community will not only connect to your dedicated stream for news and
updates and send messages to you but they will ‚Äòretweet‚Äô your
information to people they know thereby expanding your audience.
Anything you post doesn‚Äôt necessarily have to be just about your game,
posting relevant notes, articles, news and critically your conversation
with the community is also reflected here.</p>

<p>It is also possible to extend your reach on
<strong><a href="http://twitter.com" title="Twitter">Twitter</a></strong> with the introduction of your own #hashtags (subject headings) to encourage common discussion and also discover for real-time conversations about your game using
search.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.TweetDeck.com" title="TweetDeck">[blippr]TweetDeck[/blippr]</a></strong> is an awesome tool for doing all of the above in one easy to use, free
package.</p>

<h2 id="rss-feeds">RSS Feeds</h2>

<p>If you have a blog, or web-site with an RSS feed it is possible to
syndicate this automatically onto Facebook and Twitter, which saves some
of the leg work in releasing longer pieces of information but these are
obviously quite robotic and need to be married with real human
interaction to truly engage the community.</p>

<p>I would advice running your RSS feeds via services such as
<a href="http://Feedburner.Google.Com" title="Feedburner">[blippr]FeedBurner[/blippr]</a> to enable more powerful subscriptions through email, and embedded sharing</p>

<h2 id="link-tracking">Link Tracking</h2>

<p>The use of link shortening sites can have a beneficial side-effect in
that they usually incorporate link tracking took. The ubiquitous
<a href="http://bit.ly" title="Bit.Ly">[blippr]Bit.Ly[/blippr]</a> provides some fantastic tools for discovering the popularity and reach of items you link to, including</p>

<h2 id="community-managers">Community Managers</h2>

<p>I‚Äôd say from the outset that if you have big ambitions, or you have a
big title, then you should <strong>engage a specific community manager to be
successful</strong>. I have been fortunate to work with a great community
manager and I have witnessed what a real difference this can make, this
is a skill that is not to be under-estimated. They can engage with your
audience in a concise meaningful way and really understand the chaotic
world of relationships.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>In a nutshell, there are no easy ways to work with communities, you‚Äôve
just go to go there and put in the effort. The invaluable feedback and
interactions you encourage frequently pays back your efforts many fold.</p>
