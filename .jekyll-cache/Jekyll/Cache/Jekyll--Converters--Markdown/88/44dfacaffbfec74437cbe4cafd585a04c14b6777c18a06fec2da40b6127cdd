I"Ş<p>I often wander between favouring and hating the idea of a 9-5 culture at
work. On the one hand it fits in nicely with a family life where we work
to enjoy ourselves, we turn up, do some work, go home and disconnect and
plug ourselves into an entirely separate life.</p>

<p>On the other hand, what we do as game developers is a creative process,
it requires thinking, passion and creativity that simply cannot be
turned on and off at preset times of day.</p>

<p>Imagine a day like
this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>9am â€“ be creative and passionate when you punch in</li>
  <li>12pm â€“ stop being creative and thinking about your art.</li>
  <li>1pm â€“ start being creative again, now, youâ€™ve only got 4.5hrs
remaining</li>
  <li>5.30pm â€“ stop thinking, park your creativity, go home, disconnect</li>
  <li>rinse and repeat.</li>
</ul>

<p>What happens if Iâ€™m on the brink of a brilliant discovery at 17:15 and I
need that extra bit of time but I have to leave at 17:30?</p>

<p>I would argue that this simply suits a certain time of person and that
person isnâ€™t into making games they love, theyâ€™re looking for a job
churning out mundane average â€œproductâ€. Something to do to get paid for
and keep them off the streets, something they donâ€™t have to think about
and get emotionally invested in. Maybe theyâ€™ve been burned out and are
looking for an easy life, 9-5 does have itâ€™s appeal sometimes.</p>

<p>A corporate culture like this will ultimately mean that the business
itself becomes a function of itâ€™s indoctrined staff, a reflection of the
people who work there and the ones who made the decision to make it like
this. This may succeed for a time but I can only guess that it wonâ€™t
last forever.</p>

<p>Now, I am absolutely not advocating disregarding Working Time
Regulations and forcing people to work every hour of the day. Iâ€™m not
saying to over-burden people so they have no choice.</p>

<p>What I am saying is that people donâ€™t think and contribute in this
prescribed manner, people change, some people are so into what theyâ€™re
doing that they want to work weekends anyway, you just canâ€™t stop them.
Sometimes you have an off day and havenâ€™t got an idea in your head.
Youâ€™re fundamentally being told that caring about what you do isnâ€™t what
your employer is looking for and the consequence of this is that you
will find another outlet.</p>

<p>I think that flexibility is the key here and enabling people to
contribute as much as they can to their art, in a way that suits them
(within reason) can only be a good thing for the game and the business.
We should be results focused and not get hung up on whether someone
clocks in at a prescribed time.</p>

<p>We demand a lot from our developers and we need to recognise and
reciprocate the gift of time and effort.</p>

<p><strong>Do I support hard 9-5 working hours? No, for all the reasons above</strong></p>

<p><strong>Do I support developers making games with passion and creativity,
whenever that may be? Yes</strong></p>
