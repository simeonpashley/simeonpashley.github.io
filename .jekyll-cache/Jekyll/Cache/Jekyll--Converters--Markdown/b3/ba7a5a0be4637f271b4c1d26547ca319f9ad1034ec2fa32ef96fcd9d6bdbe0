I"ù<p>In 2008, Gladwellâ€™s book <em>â€œOutliers: The Story of Successâ€</em> repeatedly mentions the â€œ10,000-Hour Ruleâ€, claiming that the key to success in any field is, to a large extent, a matter of practicing a specific task for a total of around 10,000 hours. This equates to 1,250 working days, or 5 working years of focus on your core skill.</p>

<p>Is this how long it took you to get to call yourself a successful? I
certainly wonder just how much of anyoneâ€™s skill or experience is
relevant anymore. I believe only the last 5 years is relevant to what
you do as the rest is just old hat and knowledge that can be easily
achieved by someone chasing your heels.</p>

<p>The kicker is, it can all disappear in an instant for no apparent
reason.</p>
