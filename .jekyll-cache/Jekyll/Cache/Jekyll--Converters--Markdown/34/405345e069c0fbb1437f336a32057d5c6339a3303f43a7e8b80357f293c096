I"B<p>If you’re OSX disk usage is being reported incorrectly then you’ve
probably got caught by a Time Machine feature introduced in Apple OSX
10.7. This typically happens where your free disk space erodes over time
or when you delete some files and yet the disk still claims to have the
same space usage as before.</p>
