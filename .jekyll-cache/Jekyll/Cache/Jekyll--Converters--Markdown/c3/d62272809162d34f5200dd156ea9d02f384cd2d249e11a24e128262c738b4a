I"—<p>Hmmmâ€¦. this could be a tough one to work out. Imagine all of the power
used; development hardware like PCs, food eaten, servers, travel for
business and commuting, air-conditioning, manufacturing of the discs,
manuals the list goes on and on. Donâ€™t forget everything at the
publisher too. A killer title like God Of War 3, Modern Warfare 2 or
Dead Redemption must have an astronomical footprint!</p>
