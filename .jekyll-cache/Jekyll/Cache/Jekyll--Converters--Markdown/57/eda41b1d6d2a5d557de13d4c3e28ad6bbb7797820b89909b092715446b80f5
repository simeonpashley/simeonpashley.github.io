I"¼<p>I walked into a minefield of problems when attempting to connect back to
my Synology DS210j after a regular firmware update. The approved desktop
application <strong>DSAssistant</strong> was used to upload and apply the firmware
but something just went wrong. DSAssistant claimed the IP address was
set, but the device wouldnâ€™t accept web connections. I eventually found
a solution that helped me get the device back up &amp; running.</p>
