I"à<p>Do you ever use search engines to find a product or service on the
Internet, rather than physically getting in your car and driving to the
local department store?Â  Youâ€™re not alone. Millions of others are doing
the same every day. How often do you go beyond the first two search
results pages to find what youâ€™re looking for?Â  How about beyond the
first few entries on the first page?</p>

<p>Perhaps without realising it, youâ€™ve just demonstrated know how SEO
(Search Engine Optimisation) can boost the â€˜page rankâ€™ of your own
business website.</p>

<h2 id="page-ranking-determines-success">Page Ranking Determines Success</h2>

<p>What exactly is page rank? Page rank determines whether potential
customers will find your business on page one of a web search, or page
1,022.Â  The ultimate goal is for your website to be the first business
listed on the first page. Generally, buyers of products and services
type a specific word or words into their browser to describe what
theyâ€™re looking for. For example, â€˜Jamaica travelâ€™ or â€˜cruise to
Bermudaâ€™. If they know the name of your business, even better, because
the search engines return hundreds, thousands, even millions of results
that match the words they are using to search, either completely or
partially. The customer then browses through page oneâ€¦maybe page twoâ€¦but
very few will go beyond that to find what theyâ€™re looking for.</p>

<p>Many factors go into putting your company on page one, but great
business web design is one excellent way to boost your page rank and
bring customers knocking at your virtual door and scheduling vacations,</p>

<p>SEO Boosts Rankings
Through:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Key Words and Phrases</strong></li>
  <li>Increased Relevance</li>
  <li>Popularity</li>
  <li>Improved</li>
  <li>Weeding Out the Competition</li>
</ul>

<p>Although success does not usually happen overnight, with good SEO, your
business website will rise swiftly through the ranks, moving your online
presence from the back page to front of all the competition.Â  Hereâ€™s
how:</p>

<h1 id="key-words-and-phrases">Key Words and Phrases</h1>

<p>When consumers are looking for a business via the Internet, they do not
put a complete description in the text box.Â  Likewise, general words may
bring up a whole slew of sites having nothing to do with the need. For
example, typing in â€˜the renaissanceâ€™ as a search term brings up results
related to The Middle Ages, an investment firm called Renaissance, a
search engine marketing club, and others. If your business is named
â€˜Renaissanceâ€™, it may be listed on the 3rd page or further down, and
will never be found by the visitor. Therefore, targeted words or phrases
help narrow down the choices for optimal sites to peruse. In a case
where the business name is similar to many other company names, other
SEO strategies and keywords can help in this regard. With good SEO, your
pages will be peppered with the most common words used to consumers to
find what your business has to offer.</p>

<h2 id="increased-relevance">Increased Relevance</h2>

<p>With proper key words and phrases blended into your web site content,
your business website design and pages will increase in relevance, which
translates into more consumer dollars spent on your site.Â  During a
search for business, the competition will be left in the dust, if your
page pops up as the most relevant to the consumerâ€™s search terms. The
best SEO companies, like business Web Design, know how to uncover what
people are searching for to get the best results.</p>

<h2 id="popularity">Popularity</h2>

<p>As soon as your site begins to show more traffic (visitors), search
engines will pick up on its growing popularity.Â  Then, subsequent
searches will be more likely to see your business chosen as the best.
Thus, your page ranking has hit a major milestone in page rank. Soon,
search engines scour the web for pertinent information, and your
business will be at the top of the list.</p>

<h2 id="improved">Improved</h2>

<p>As your pages increase in popularity and begin to rank higher, you can
track how improved
start elsewhere and end up on your page.Â  With great
business web design will be instrumental in out-selling the competition,
and your bottom line will reflect that change.</p>

<h2 id="weeding-out-the-competition">Weeding Out the Competition</h2>

<p>Itâ€™s simple supply and demand. As your business grows, your competitors
will be further left behind. Your pages will rank even higher than
before. Finally, the first page, and possibly first place, is attainable
thanks to SEO.</p>
