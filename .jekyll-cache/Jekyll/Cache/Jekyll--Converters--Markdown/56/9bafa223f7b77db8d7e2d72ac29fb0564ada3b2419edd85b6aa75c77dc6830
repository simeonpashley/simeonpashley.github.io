I"¤<p>There are many ways to communicate with people, whatâ€™s your preference?</p>

<p>I have to admit that I find telephone conversations the hardest, they
fall between the disconnection of something like email or status updates
and the â€˜properâ€™ face-to-face meetings we have with people every day.
Telephone conversations also tend to be one-to-one too, conference calls
are a nightmare. Thereâ€™s no visual clues on when itâ€™s anyoneâ€™s time to
talk or how people are reacting.</p>

<p>We all know Itâ€™s entirely possible to hide behind emails, you can spend
hours crafting every word, editing and re-editing until your happy.</p>

<p>Meeting up with people is always fun, the spontaneity and interaction
obviously surpasses everything else.</p>

<p>Iâ€™d rather write a long, carefully crafted email or make a long distance
journey to meet up than make a call.</p>

<p>Everyoneâ€™s different, do you have a preference?</p>
