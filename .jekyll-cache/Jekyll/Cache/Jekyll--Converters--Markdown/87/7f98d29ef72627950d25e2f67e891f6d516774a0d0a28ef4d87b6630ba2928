I"Í<p>Iâ€™ve seen my game pitches in my time, and Iâ€™ve made quite a few myself
but Iâ€™m continually amazed and just what some people think theyâ€™re
doing. Â Think about all those poor saps whoâ€™ve been sent to the
slaughter on â€œX Factorâ€ for our amusement when they totally and utterly
fail to deliver anything that a mother wouldnâ€™t love. Â Think about all
those sorry ideas youâ€™ve seen on Dragonâ€™s Den that are just pitiful. But
it doesnâ€™t have to be this wayâ€¦</p>

<p>When Iâ€™ve been on the receiving end, it often feels like â€œX Factorâ€, the
person pitching stands up, stumbles to introduce themselves and then
proceeds to claim theyâ€™ve got the best thing youâ€™ve ever seen, all their
friends and colleagues have seen it and theyâ€™re passionate about it.
Itâ€™s the next GTA, or God Of War, or Forzaâ€¦and thenâ€¦.sitting on the
edge of my seat I waitâ€¦out comes the pitch and the presentation to go
with it. I finally get to see something and oh dear, oh dear, it rarely
lives up to the hype and expectations that the person pitching sets.</p>

<p>The sad part is, some of the games are actually fundamentally good and
itâ€™s just that pitch itself and / or the person pitching is bad. Both of
these are fixable or at least made a little bit easier.</p>

<h3 id="heres-a-few-pointers-to-get-you-started">Hereâ€™s a few pointers to get you started</h3>

<ol>
  <li><strong>X Statement.</strong> Produce a concise statement that sums up your
gameÂ succinctly. It should capture the essence of what youâ€™re game
is about and set realistic expectations. Itâ€™s difficult to do, and
even harder to do well, but the thought behind it will cause you to
explore what youâ€™re really pitching.</li>
  <li><strong>Who Am I? What Am I doing? Why do I care?</strong> These are things I
want to know as a gamer, to check if this is something I want to
play. Ask yourself these questions to ensure that youâ€™ve covered
these key topics in your pitch.</li>
  <li><strong>Would your mother understand it?</strong> When youâ€™ve written your pitch,
ask yourself if your mother would understand what youâ€™re saying or
showing. This may seem silly but remember that the people youâ€™re
pitching to have to understand your proposition in 15-20 minutes.
They havenâ€™t lived with every nuance of the design for months and
know everything youâ€™re implying.</li>
  <li><strong>Itâ€™s all about you.</strong> There are many case studies that show that a
large part of someone accepting the pitch is whether they like the
person (and team) pitching the idea. If you come across as
unsure,Â incompetent, uncaring then why would you care should you get
the work? This can be a tough one to crack when youâ€™ve taken the
same idea around lots of people but itâ€™s very important to get
right. Stay fresh or go home.</li>
  <li><strong>Make every word and image count.</strong> Optimise the life out of your
presentation when itâ€™s ready to make sure youâ€™re maximising your
presentation time, communicating efficiently and clearly, not
repeating key statements and getting everything you want to say in
there.</li>
  <li><strong>Keep it simple</strong> This is a little different to point 3, Iâ€™m
referring to the content itself. Your objective is to hook the
person and start a conversation about your pitch. Shy away from
going into uber detail that would scare someone off, keep numbers to
a minimum, keep the text light on each page.</li>
  <li><strong>Practise, practise, practice.</strong> I mean this. Really practice your
pitch, think about every word. The reason is that when it comes to
presentation time youâ€™ll know what youâ€™re going to say, remember
everything you want to get across and also, critically, be more
confident about what youâ€™re doing.</li>
</ol>

<p>I would say that I have a pet hate, which is that the most common phrase
I hear has to be Â â€Pixar Style Animationâ€ and it fills me with dread.</p>

<p>There are 2
reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Pixar communicates a style and ethos all of itâ€™s own</strong> that goes
deeper than just itâ€™s animation, itâ€™s about how it makes you feel.
Thereâ€™s an emotion theyâ€™re you just canâ€™t put into words, but itâ€™s
there and itâ€™s what makes it so good.</li>
  <li>More importantly <strong>youâ€™ve set my expectations very high</strong> and Iâ€™m
more likely to be thinking â€œProve Itâ€ or â€œI bet it isnâ€™tâ€ before
Iâ€™ve seen anything. Iâ€™m instantly on the back foot and expecting
failure.Â What is the person trying to say in the 1st place?Iâ€™m all
for setting aspiration goals but you need to be able to prove them.
Above all, do what you say youâ€™re going to do.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are many similar phrases that you just simply have to be able to
back up. Think about what expectations your setting and if they exist in
the real world before promising them. Would you fall for it?</p>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>

<p>So, there it is, a few pointers on mostly what to avoid when preparing
your pitch and doing the presentation itself. Take your time, make sure
youâ€™re ready, donâ€™t rush and remember.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To fail to prepare is to prepare to fail</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If youâ€™re business depends on it, itâ€™s worth the time and effort to get
it right and get a professional to run through it with you! <em><a href="http://gamedevconsulting.blogspot.com/p/simeon-pashley-consultant-development.html">Shameless
