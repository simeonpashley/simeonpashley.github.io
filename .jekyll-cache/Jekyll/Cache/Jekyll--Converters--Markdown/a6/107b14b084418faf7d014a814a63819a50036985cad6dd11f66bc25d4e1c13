I""<p>I‚Äôd like to share with you my game development career experience as part
of a series of posts, the <a href="http://pashley.org/2010/08/20-years-of-a-video-game-developer-career.html">1st
part</a>talked about my early career and I followed up with a <a href="http://pashley.org/2010/08/20-years-of-a-video-game-developer%e2%80%99s-career-%e2%80%93-part-2.html">second
post</a>that was more about how those games were made.
Let‚Äôs get back on track with the series and rejoin the fun back when
the transition for PS1 to PlayStation 2 was happening.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/SDC18434-300x225.jpg" alt="PS1 development

a long and fruitful period of key game development the rest of the world
was moving over to PlayStation 2 but we were still making games for PS1.</p>

<p>It wasn‚Äôt for lack of effort and respect, indeed I attended many
exclusive PS1 &amp; Saturn developer conferences across the globe. Over the
years, the PS1 conferences were held in a variety of amazing locations
including secret clubs and even in the middle of the top-secret
high-speed ring at <a href="http://www.millbrook.co.uk">Millbrook Proving
Grounds</a>. Saturn conferences were always held just outside of San Jose, California where I visited later as the venue for the emerging GD Conference, which I was also fortunate to regularly attend.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/609px-Solar_eclips_1999_4_NR.jpg" alt="" title="Total Solar Eclipse" />I was
also chosen for the exclusive 1st unveiling of the PS2 to the ‚Äúcream of
the development community‚Äù at a <a href="http://www.barcelo-hotels.co.uk/hotels/northern-england/barcelo-shrigley-hall-hotel-cheshire">secret
location</a>along with short list of developers. What made this event totally cool was that it took place right before a solar eclipse gripped the UK and the event itself opened with a mock solar eclipse!</p>

<p>I was doing <a href="http://spashley.tripod.com/gfx/bw/ctw_2001_09_14.html">magazine
interviews</a> and I even made it onto TV once!</p>

<p>This is largely because we were one of the best studios in the world for
doing this work and that meant that we were the ones who bigger
businesses wanted to keep pushing the same work to and we were type-cast
as safe PS1 developers. However this PS1 work was always going to come
to an end at some point. The visual quality and scope of even the best
PS1 games was rapidly becoming lack lustre when compared to what was
appearing on PS2 and PC at the time that really reinforced the demise.
This eventually led to some of our projects being cancelled as the PS1
nose-dived and it took our company with it.</p>

<p>Sadly, the studio imploded and a few of us took the mantle and tried to
breathe life back into it under a new name ‚ÄòTeque Software‚Äô where I
played the role of Technical Director along side 2 other directors but
it just didn‚Äôt work out and it only lasted for a few months as we still
had the same reputation that we just couldn‚Äôt shake off. This was
becoming worse as the other ‚Äònew‚Äô studios were pushing ahead on the
newer platforms and we were getting further behind.</p>

<p>The closure of the studio came as a surprise to pretty much everyone
involved but if you‚Äôve ever ran a business in the UK you‚Äôll appreciate
the secrecy that these things have to be done under. As much as I wanted
to tell people, I couldn‚Äôt as that would have been a clear breach of my
responsibilities to the business as a director. I would have probably
been in a lot of legal trouble if I‚Äôd have done it too. So, the closure
of the studio left a bitter taste in a lot of people‚Äôs¬†mouths and
everyone scattered to find new jobs all over the UK. I had a
double-whammy here because my wife also worked there too, meaning that
we were both redundant on the same day.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/81816401MHMCub_ph-300x225.jpg" alt="" title="PS2 Devkits" />After the end of
Krisalis¬†I quickly found a job going back to my roots as a programmer on
PlayStation 2 where I worked on core animation related programming
systems for a licensed platform game. Sadly, it turned out that
Runecraft‚Äôs management were a bunch of crooks and totally shafted their
staff but I didn‚Äôt find that out until later.</p>

<p>What I did get out of this period was an opportunity to connect with
some talented people and also work on PlayStation 2 games and really
learn about those. I fortunately was seconded to a remote part of
Runecraft that was based in Leeds, 15 miles away from the head office.
This meant that we had little involvement with HQ and we could just get
on with things.</p>

<p>I met a lot of truly great people in Leeds, all of which were ex-Sony
Leeds and most had worked on the likes of Wipeout / Colony Wars. Their
skills were amazing and a real level above what I‚Äôd seen at Krisalis and
I learned absolutely loads and I still connect with these people today.</p>

<p>Getting back to non-management roots was refreshing and re-filled my
technical knowledge to a level where I understood the nuts &amp; bolts of
PS2 development that I‚Äôd later find to be incredibly useful.</p>

<p>The over promising and dodgy dealings of the management caught up with
them and the company collapsed inwards. There‚Äôs only so many times you
can try to deceive a publisher before they find you out and that‚Äôs
inevitable.</p>

<p>How the Leeds studio closed was like something out of a movie. I was
making my way into work and I got a call from one of the other
programmers that things were kicking off. I eventually made it to the
studio to find the doors locked and all of my colleagues stood outside.
I was told the studio had closed and we were all redundant. Now, given
we all pretty much hated the management this was both a blessing and a
curse at the same time.</p>

<p>The door opened to the studio and a head popped out and called a name,
that person was escorted to their desk where they collected their
personal belongings and then escorted off the premises. This process was
repeated for everyone in the studio, a slow one-by-one procession.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/1266-300x225.jpg" alt="It didn't happen quite like
this" title="It didn't happen quite like this" />The mob
was angry but I never got to see the end of it. Why? Because it turned
out my contractual place of work was back at HQ along with 2 others from
the Leeds studio. What happened next was just bizarre, one of those MPV
like vehicles turned up and the 3 of us were bundled into the back along
with one of the managers and we were driven back to HQ. I‚Äôm not
exaggerating, this is really what happened. When we arrived we were
escorted to our¬†separate¬†desks in the ‚Äòprogramming barn‚Äô and told to do
some work on project X. To say I was surprised was an under-statement
and they almost dismissed the fact that any of this had happened but you
can imagine I vowed to leave ASAP. I was completely annoyed because my
transport home was back at the Leeds office so when I was released I had
to go back there, then back home. It‚Äôs making me angry just writing this
now.</p>

<p>I suffered this for a few weeks while I found another job but I
absolutely hated it as we treated as immigrants, we were given all the
terrible jobs and we weren‚Äôt motivated to really do any work either.</p>

<p>What I learned was that annex/remote studios are always the 1st things
to go when a company is hitting financial troubles. It‚Äôs like cutting
off a gangrenous limb to save the body. All of the work can be brought
back in-house and it gives the business a clear criteria to dump a load
of people.</p>

<p>I also learned that a tight-knit group of motivated and happy developers
can achieve more than the sum of their parts.</p>

<h3 id="what-next-onwards-and-upwards">What next? Onwards and upwards</h3>

<p>I was fortunate to be have formed strong relationships with people
across the industry and I was brought in as employee #2 for the newly
formed Kuju studio in Sheffield where the next phase of my career began
including many of the people I‚Äôd worked with in Leeds on the emerging
platforms.</p>

<p>This is where we‚Äôll join the story next time‚Ä¶</p>
