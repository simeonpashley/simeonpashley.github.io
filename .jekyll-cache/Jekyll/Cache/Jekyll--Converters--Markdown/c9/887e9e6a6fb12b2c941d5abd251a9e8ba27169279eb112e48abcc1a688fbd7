I"«<p>Yesterday Iâ€™ve spent like 7 hours trying to upload music and videos to
my iPhone. Nice going Apple, you put more effort into making the device
impossible to work with, instead of solving known issues. Anyways, I
finally did get it working, and it works really, really well. There were
actually several methods I found to work, but only this one doesnâ€™t
freeze. The software is called IMTOO iPhone Computer Transfer.</p>
