Thereâ€™s an interesting post over on GameProducer.net about how Juuso
uses Twitter as part of his game blog that I wanted to emulate here.</p>

<p>I use my @simeonpashley Twitter feed largely to auto-post new articles
from this blog. This is done automatically when I hit publish so itâ€™s
the best way to keep up-to-date. Simply <a href="http://twitter.com/simeonpashley">follow
us</a> and youâ€™re all set.</p>

<p>I also follow other people in the games industry, not companies, and
join in chats there and also RT (re-tweet) anything I find interesting
and relevant to game development. I also follow events such as #e3expo,
#develop2010 and #gamescom and RT interesting items too.</p>

<p>As Juuso says, you really need a client to use Twitter as the basic web
service really doesnâ€™t scratch the surface of whatâ€™s possible.
I use Tweetdeck on my iPhone, Home Mac and work PC as itâ€™s by far the
best app. I use Twitterific on iPad as TD isnâ€™t very good yet.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re starting out, start by following me then go through my lists
and add people from there. Most people will follow you back and itâ€™s a
good way to kick start your Twitter addiction.</p>

<p>Hashtags are pretty much like public chat channels, you simply follow a
hash tag and you join the conversation. This can be an amazing way of
getting involved in a community. Iâ€™ve met lots of people on these
channels who I continue to chat with on a daily basis. Find a channel,
add people for the channel as theyâ€™re obviously interested and engaged
in that subject.</p>

<p>I follow:
#xblig - Xbox Live Independant Games
#gamedev - general game development
#iPhone - broad iPhone chat
#leanstartup - small business bootstrapping</p>

<p>Event specific ones pop up too such as
#gamescom
#develop2010
#e3expo</p>

<p>Joining Twitter was one of the best things Iâ€™ve done for. Long time and
Iâ€™d consider it pretty much mandatory for game debs to keep up with a
rapidly changing industry.</p>

<p>Which people and #hashtags do you follow?</p>
