I"æ<p>I recently chose to take up the challenge of using github.io to host my long-standing blog.</p>

<p>As I write, Iâ€™ve hopefully move all of my old posts over to Jekyll Markdown format by the magic of some scripts, some regex search &amp; replace and some sheer effort.</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s a few missing edges but Iâ€™m hopeful that keeping the content in Markdown format will mean I donâ€™t have to go through this pain again.</p>

<p>Some of the images didnâ€™t make it through the process so Iâ€™ll be churning through those in the coming days.</p>

<p>Issues to solve:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Missing images</li>
  <li>Random post dates &amp; times</li>
  <li>Formatting/style issues lost in translation (Tables are going to be fun!)</li>
</ul>
