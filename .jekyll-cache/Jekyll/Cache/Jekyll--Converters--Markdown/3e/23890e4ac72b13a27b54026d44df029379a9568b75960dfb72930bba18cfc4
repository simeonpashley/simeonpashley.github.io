I"|<p>If there’s one thing I hate, it’s receiving an automated reply from a
small business, in particular one that’s supposed to connect with me as
a person. OK, I’ll confess I’m having a rant about recruitment agencies,
which is a pretty dangerous thing to do when you’re looking for work.</p>

<p>I have a special hatred for ones that pretend to be from a person. <strong>I
know you’re not there</strong> due to the nature and content of your email so
the “personal touch” is just lost. There’s no name, there’s nothing.</p>

<p>Also, <strong>PLEASE don’t direct me to a web-site to fill in my details</strong>. If
you’re too busy to even bother to talk to me in the first place and find
out about me then I know for definite you won’t “process” my CV in a
meaningful way and you definitely won’t find me something that’s
relevant.</p>

<p>There’s one fundamental point, <strong>I know you only get paid when I find a
job</strong>! In the modern world I have many means of finding work <strong>but</strong> I
recognise that the recruitment role is important and can make a real
difference.</p>

<p>My point is, <strong>there are recruiters out there who maintain the personal
touch</strong> and they succeed and get my vote every time.</p>

<p>When I get back to recruiting, which I will, I will absolutely focus on
the agencies who I had the best experience with from both sides.</p>

<p>Make it personal, make the candidate feel like you have their best
interests at heart and you’re not just looking  for your next 10%.</p>

<p>What’s your experience been like? Recommendations? Story to tell? Keep
in touch.</p>
