I"¶B<p>I wanted to share with you a presentation about <strong>Where The Money Goes</strong>
that is received from making video games. I made this presentation a few
years ago to a game development studio I was running at the time and I
believe everyone found it useful and gained a better understanding of
where the money that comes into the business goes before it pays their
wages and why â€˜whenâ€™ it comes in is important too. Iâ€™ve updated this
post since then with more up-to-date principles, information and costs
as I learn new things ever day.</p>

<p>These are general principles that apply to any business and Iâ€™m going to
cover the basics to hold on tight, <strong>feel free to ask me any questions
in the comments section</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="breaking-out-where-the-money-goes">Breaking out where the money goes</h3>

<p>MyÂ initial motivation for writing this post was to answer a question Iâ€™d
long since asked myself when I was starting
out: â€œWhy do I get paid so little when the business is getting lots of money?â€. I wanted to help people understand what the business spent its money on before they got their wages. I appreciate that everyone wasnâ€™t stupid and just thought that 100% of the money coming in went straight to wages but I think there were various pieces of the pie missing.</p>

<h4 id="mid-size-studio">Mid-Size Studio</h4>

<p>Iâ€™ll start with an example pie chart that includes typical costs that
are taken out of revenue fees received for development of a game for a
mid-size UK studio containing about 35 staff or more. Again, these are
typical but vary depending on the nature of your business.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/WagesGraph.png" alt="WagesGraph" title="WagesGraph" /></p>

<p>Letâ€™s walk through the components of this
example:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Wages</strong> - this is the gross salary you receive before tax and
national insurance costs are taken off</li>
  <li><strong>Corporate NIC</strong> - These are the National Insurance contributions a
UK business makes in addition to the NI payments you make yourself</li>
  <li><strong>Benefits</strong> - this is a general roll up for things such as bonus,
pensions, healthcare, time-off in lieu and a myriad of other things</li>
  <li><strong>Recruitment</strong> - this is the money the company pays to the
recruitment agency that got you the job and Iâ€™ve chosen a figure I
think is typical. Itâ€™s typically a one-off payment made when you
pass your probation period. This figure obviously varies massively
depending on the deal your employer has and may not even exist if
you applied direct.</li>
</ul>

<p>We then have 2 more figures that scale with your business but weâ€™ll
assume that they apply in a linear fashion for this example</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Business Costs</strong> - this figure of 40% is typical and includes a
whole host of costs that <strong>Iâ€™ll go into later.</strong> Needless to say
that if thereâ€™s only 1 of you then itâ€™s going to be 100% cost
against your salary.</li>
  <li><strong>Platform Fee</strong> - many platforms such as Apple, Sony, Microsoft all
take 30% of the revenue received as a platform fee. Itâ€™s a way for
them to recoup the costs of developer support, administration,
marketing and whatever else they consider worthy. Iâ€™ve taken this
30% and applied it directly to your salary as a â€˜taxâ€™ to show the
amount of money required to pay your wages.</li>
</ul>

<p>Using these figures, your salary comes in at 39% of gross revenue, i.e.,
<strong>for every Â£1 you earn the game needs to earn Â£2.55</strong>.</p>

<p>Lets take an array of price points a game may sell at to find out how
many games youâ€™d need to sell for you to get Â£1 and also an example
salary of Â£36,000.</p>

<p><strong>Price Point</strong></p>

<p><strong>Unit Sales to get your Â£1</strong></p>

<p><strong>Unit Sales to get Â£36k salary</strong></p>

<p>Â£39.99</p>

<p>0.06</p>

<p>2,294</p>

<p>Â£19.99</p>

<p>0.13</p>

<p>4,589</p>

<p>Â£9.99</p>

<p>0.26</p>

<p>9,182</p>

<p>Â£4.99</p>

<p>0.51</p>

<p>18,382</p>

<p>Â£1.99</p>

<p>1.28</p>

<p>46,094</p>

<p>Â£0.59</p>

<p>4.32</p>

<p>155,471</p>

<p>As we can see, if let unchecked typical business costs could easily
career out of control and result in a game never breaking even.</p>

<h4 id="lean-studio">Lean Studio</h4>

<p>Of course not every studio is like this so lets take a further example
of a â€˜lean studioâ€™ where all the costs are as thin as possible and Iâ€™d
assume this is typical of a micro or nano studio of employees, not
self-employed people.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/LeanBusiness.png" alt="LeanBusiness" title="LeanBusiness" /></p>

<p>Blitzing through the points about we get to a salary taking up 59% of
the revenue or in other words <strong>for every Â£1 you earn the game needs to
earn Â£1.72</strong>. This figure is obviously much lower because all the costs
have been stripped out.</p>

<p>Again, using the same format as before we can arrive at some figures for
how many units youâ€™d need to sell to break-even and get your money back.</p>

<hr />

<div>             **Unit Sales to get your Â£1**   **Unit Sales to get Â£36k salary**

**Price Point**

  </div>

<p>Â£39.99 0.04 1,545</p>

<p>Â£19.99 0.09 3,090</p>

<p>Â£9.99 0.17 6,184</p>

<p>Â£4.99 0.34 12,380</p>

<p>Â£1.99 0.86 31,043</p>

<p>Â£0.59 2.91 104,705</p>

<hr />

<p>Stripping away the costs obviously means you need to sell fewer games to
get the same amount of cash in your pocket at the end of the day.</p>

<p>I know I keep saying this but there are so many variables at play and
they apply to different components at different rates and these are
indicative numbers only but it doesnâ€™t take long to get these figures
for any game, studio or business and I have a myriad of tools to capture
and expose these costs as well as work out what the break-even unit
sales and costs are for numerous platforms.</p>

<p>E.g., How many units of a game would you need to sell on iPhone to
break-even?</p>

<h3 id="business-costs">Business Costs</h3>

<p>Thereâ€™s a large chunk of they money that goes into a mysterious pot
called â€˜business costsâ€™ and this little section includes everything that
the business pays for outside of salary costs. Lets take a look at a
list of the obvious
ones:</p>

<h4 id="project-costs">Project Costs</h4>

<p>First, lets take a look through some typical costs that come in at the
project level and are duplicated for every project the studio
undertakes:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>I.T. Rentals</strong> - this is the cost of the hardware &amp; software you
use every day to make the
game: desktop machines, laptops, monitors,
dev kits, art packages, IDEs, etc.</li>
  <li><strong>Middleware</strong> - if you use any licensed software such as Unreal,
Unity, Scaleform, SpeedTree or anything else like this.</li>
  <li><strong>Outsourcing</strong>: Art, Anim, Audio - these are other costs for the
work done by people outside of your studio</li>
  <li><strong>QA</strong> - engaging people to test your game costs money, whether it
be Â£50 to your friend or employing 100+ people to get your game from
Alpha to Master</li>
  <li><strong>Materials</strong> - all the other bits &amp; pieces you
consume: blank
media, pens, paper, ink for the printer, books, reference games,
etc.</li>
  <li><strong>Travel</strong> - travel to see publishers, marketing events or trade
shows all costs money.</li>
  <li><strong>Training</strong> - now youâ€™re at the event you probably need a ticket to
get in, or maybe a specific training course</li>
  <li><strong>Subsistence -</strong> maybe youâ€™re old skool and get some Pizzas in
during crunch, maybe you like to take the team out on occasion or
even just a Christmas party.</li>
  <li><strong>Agent fees</strong> - some companies use agents to help them get their
games signed up to publishers and deals are typically based on a
percentage of gross revenue and 10% is a typical value.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="studio-costs">Studio Costs</h4>

<p>Secondly, the studio itself costs money to run if youâ€™re making 20 games
or even if youâ€™re not making any games at all!</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Office space</strong> - the space itself costs money to rent, plus
thereâ€™s local taxes, insurance and all sorts of maintenance youâ€™ll
be needing</li>
  <li><strong>Utilities -</strong> internet, electric, water and the air-con for your
server room need to keep on being delivered for you to keep going</li>
  <li><strong>Equipment -</strong> desks, chairs, servers, shelves, whiteboards,</li>
  <li><strong>Management -</strong> larger studios have people who donâ€™t actually make
the games on the front line but are still there and for corporations
these include people youâ€™ll probably never see including CEOs,
Studio Managers, Production, IT, Office Admin, Finance, Marketing,
etc.</li>
  <li><strong>Sales</strong> - The studio needs to sell both itself and itâ€™s games with
personal visits, trade show attendance and maybe adverts in trade
magazines for recruitment.</li>
  <li><strong>Events</strong> â€“ Does your studio have events to celebrate key
milestones being passed? Summer Events? Christmas Parties?</li>
  <li><strong>Legal &amp; Finance</strong> - Maybe you need to use accountants to run
through your figures or audit your returns? Business contracts need
a valid legal pass over them that usually involves engaging a
specialised lawyer. If youâ€™re working on long international
contracts then maybe you need to dabble in Forward Exchange rates?</li>
  <li><strong>Miscellaneous</strong> - Thereâ€™s a myriad of small costs such as postage,
blackberry fees, free fruit, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="tick-all-that-apply">Tick All That Apply</h4>

<p>The items listed above are ones I typically find and look for in a games
business but just like us, theyâ€™re all very unique and the costs vary
wildly and in some cases may not apply at all depending on how the
business is setup.</p>

<h3 id="when-the-money-comes-in">When The Money Comes In</h3>

<p>So far weâ€™ve covered a broad range of topics about where the money goes
so lets work through some examples of When The Money Comes In as this is
critical for any business, whether youâ€™re making games or anything else.</p>

<p>In my experience, the lack of understanding and focus on <strong>Cash Flow</strong>
is what kills businesses very quickly and is particularly important for
<strong>Work For Hire</strong> studios who rely on doing work and getting paid for it
so they can in turn pay their bills.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s an example timeline for a work-for-hire studio when they send
their milestone after spending 1 month working on it and considering
typical contracted dates for payment terms that happens in an ideal
world. The reality is that these dates slip on both sides but weâ€™ll
cover that later.</p>

<p>We can see that it can be typically <strong>at least 45Â  days before any
payment is received</strong> and for those paying attention this is <strong>after
your next monthly salary run.</strong> Even in an idealistic world, this causes
strains on the businesses cash flow.</p>

<h4 id="delayed-revenue">Delayed Revenue</h4>

<p>Iâ€™m sure you can imagine the cascading effect of slipping dates anywhere
in
here: slipped delivery, delayed approval or late payment can all bring a business to itâ€™s knees very quickly.</p>

<p>Diving a little deeper we can see the effect of delaying revenue by 1
month on a business thatâ€™s expecting consistent monthly revenue.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s what this example should look like where the money is received
consistently, no slips, no delays and everything is perfect.</p>

<hr />

<p>Revenue
Costs
Net Profit
Acc Profit</p>

<hr />

<p>Now lets take this and delay 1 of the payments by 1 month and we can see
the dramatic effect this has on the business as itâ€™s forced to support
all the costs without any money in the bank to do so.</p>

<p>This is what happens when <strong>Milestones slip by 1 month</strong> and Iâ€™m sure
you can imagine what happens if this keeps slipping and slipping with
the studio <strong>incurring more costs with no more revenue coming in</strong>, just
the figure that was promised. If the studio doesnâ€™t have enough cash in
the bank then this could be fatal.</p>

<hr />

<p>Revenue
Costs
Net Profit
Acc. Profit</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="increased-costs">Increased Costs</h4>

<p>Taking a slightly different view we can see the effect of the project
costs increasing in Month 1 resulting in the studio spending all itâ€™s
money just paying the bills. Since the profit isnâ€™t increasing the
buffer isnâ€™t building up so if thereâ€™s any late delivery then itâ€™s
curtains for the project and it could be for the studio.</p>

<p>This can happen when the team size increased to cope with late delivery
or scope increases without a corresponding increase in the revenues.</p>

<hr />

<p>Revenue
Costs
Net Profit
Acc. Profit</p>

<p><strong>Forward Planning</strong></p>

<p>I believe Iâ€™ve said this a few times by now but business costs can vary
immensely depending on the structure of your business and the working
relationships you have with your partners.</p>

<p>Being <strong>predictable and reliable is a core part of running a business</strong>
as itâ€™s easier to deal with issues if you can expect them upfront and I
believe this is a <strong>critical skill for good business managers</strong> to have.</p>

<p>This predictability becomes absolutely key if you work within a listed
company as this is typically more important than making a profit or a
loss; <strong>anticipating this, communicating it and hitting the expectations
is how these companies become successful</strong>. Amazingly, if you predict or
are expected to make a loss and then you make a profit this can be
potentially bad as it means you donâ€™t have a good grasp on your
business. The city is a complex area and people can make money even if
you lose, <strong>hitting expectations is key</strong>.</p>

<p>Growing your business and having a <strong>large volume of work brings with it
an economy of scale</strong> as the fixed costs of running the projects is
spread across a larger revenue stream. However, large volumes of work
also need more effort and support so itâ€™s a matter of getting the
balance right and choosing a level that youâ€™re comfortable with.</p>

<p>Making profit isnâ€™t just about buying yourself a Ferrari, although that
could happen one day. Your business will probably need the banked profit
some day to get through an inevitable sticky patch.</p>

<p>Profitability also brings with it <strong>more flexibility in what you do</strong> as
you can afford to speculate and take risks on projects that may be even
more profitable for you but itâ€™s no great loss if you end up breaking
even.</p>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>

<p>Iâ€™ve covered a lot of finance related topics at a very high level in
this post and thereâ€™s obviously more too it than a simple blog post can
cover but I believe itâ€™s a great introduction to the business that pays
many of our wages.</p>

<p>Not everyone wants to run an ever expanding studio as the size incurs
itâ€™s own increasing risks and stress to go with it. Striking a balance
youâ€™re happy with is important, for some itâ€™s a 1-man game making games
in their study and this low overhead, low turnover business can actually
reap more financial rewards let alone making the owner very happy that
they are in total control of their own destiny and lifestyle.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ll spare you the details of the more complex areas of corporate
finance including EBITDAR, COGS, SG&amp;A, CAPEX, gearing and leverage but
feel free to ask.</p>

<p>I hope youâ€™ve found this useful and I welcome any questions in the
comments section and Iâ€™ll answer what I can.</p>
