<p>I recently reconnected with an old friend who’s been a Freelance Game
Programmer for many years, I asked him what advice he could give to
someone just starting out and here’s his top
tips:</p>

<p>I particularly like his ethos: <em>“value-for-money &amp; minimum hassle”, because contractors/freelancers have a general reputation for being otherwise (Expensive &amp; demanding)</em></p>

<p>Here’s Rhys’ reply:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The only real tips I have are:-</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>1. If you can, try to avoid VAT registration due to the overhead of
quarterly returns, and the VAT man being able to audit you more
readily.(unless you employ someone to sort this all out)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>2. Get a good accountant, they are worth their weight in gold, as they
know what you can/cannot claim for as a legitimate business expense, and
give could advice as to where to invest your profits.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>3. Make yourself as flexible as possible. Making games is still a black
art (in terms of production especially) and so plans will almost
cetainly change from milestone to milestone. For a contractor/freelancer
it is important that you can adapt with the project (within reason). If
5 days/week becomes 6 or even 7, then you should already have plans
afoot that can support the change. It’s a second-guessing game, but it’s
worth it.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>4. In my experience, being flexible can be more valuable to production
than being fast/excellent at your work. If a producer knows they can
rely on you to be in the office on any given Sunday, they’ll take that
over having to find work for you from somewhere because you finished
your milestones early.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>5. To be honest Simeon, I’m still learning as I go along, and different
companies have different needs &amp; expectations, but my ethos (if you can
call it that) is to be “value-for-money &amp; minimum hassle”, and only
because contractors/freelancers have a general reputation for being
otherwise (Expensive &amp; demanding).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rhys is a top bloke and I highly recommend him for any programming task
you’ve got. You’ll be amazed at the knowledge Rhys has, how insightful
his views are and just how quickly and well he solves problems. Rhys is
worth his weight in gold.</p>
