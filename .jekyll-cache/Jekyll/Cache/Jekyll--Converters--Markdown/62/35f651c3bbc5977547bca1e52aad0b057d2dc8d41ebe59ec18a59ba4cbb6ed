<p>Hi, my name is Simeon and I‚Äôve been a professional software developer since 1986.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I am very passionate about building great software with good business value.</li>
  <li>I have a strong work ethic and I will do whatever it takes to deliver great results.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>SNIP</strong></p>

<p>2016- I‚Äôve taken to maintaining my history exclusively on <a href="">LinkedIn</a> page.</p>

<p>Roles include: Solutions Architect, Technical Director, Executive Producer, Project Manager and Software Developer to name but a few.</p>

<h2 id="about-the-site">About the Site</h2>

<p>I initially registered the domain <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pashley.org</code> back in 2002 to enable me to setup a friendly email domain for my family and also provide a nice domain for my personal web precense.</p>

<p>Calling this site a ‚Äúblog‚Äù is probably generous as it‚Äôs more like a random collection of my thoughts that I want to keep online and share, sometimes connected, often rare. I go through fits &amp; starts of writing so you‚Äôll probably see huge gaps in time.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve had various random sites since the mid-1990s on <a href="http://tripod.com">tripod.com</a>, <a href="http://blogger.com">blogspot.com</a> (before it became blogger) and a myriad of others. I‚Äôm currently going right back to basics using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> hosted on <a href="http://github.com/">Github Pages</a>.</p>
