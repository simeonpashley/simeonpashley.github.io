I"_<p>While most of my work is Mac/Unix based some of my business work is
built on VB.NET/ASP.NET inside a Windows development. While striving for
more robust, predictable code I chose to implement
a Continuous Integration (CI) system. I had already used CI in large
scale game production environments with great success following the TDD
model.</p>
