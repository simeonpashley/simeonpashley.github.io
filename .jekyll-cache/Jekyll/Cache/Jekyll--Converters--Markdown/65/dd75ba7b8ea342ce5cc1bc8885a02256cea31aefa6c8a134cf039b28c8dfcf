I"˜<p>I am sometimes asked how to extend the range of your home or business
Wifi network using cheap hardware and the ADSL Router your ISP gave you
for free and I wanted to share with you my tips.</p>

<div class="note">

**UPDATE:** This also works with the [D-Link DAP-1160 Wireless G Open Source Access
Point/Router](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B000VS08QC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=gamedevelcons-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B000VS08QC), although the control panel interface is different the principles still
apply.

<p>Extending your home or business Wifi network can be a great solution to
connect a remote set of devices like printers, home consoles, desktop
computers to a Wifi enabled router that sits in another room.</p>

<p>I have used this solution to extend physical networks into remote
offices and also connecting home computers and even XBox 360 to a
broader network.</p>

<p>The key to all of this is the amazing <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00019EYVG?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=gamedevelcons-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B00019EYVG">D-Link
DWL-2100AP</a>, which you can pickup for about Â£55 and itâ€™s a much cheaper and tidier alternative to running cables around and also using the ethernet over power devices.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00019EYVG?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=gamedevelcons-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B00019EYVG">D-Link
DWL-2100AP</a> is a great little device and Iâ€™ll take you through how I connected a remote home office at the bottom of a garden to the BT Homehub back in the house.</p>

<p>To extend the range of a BT Homehub you need a few
things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>D-Link 2100AP with firmware 2.2eu, the one it usually comes out of a
box with.</li>
  <li>BT Homehub v1 - the white one. <strong>NOTE</strong>: This does not work with the
black v2 Homehubs as BT disabled the WDS feature that you need</li>
  <li>Your network needs to all be running on the same sub-net, the
simplest way to do this is to simply change your netmask on
everthingÂ to 255.255.0.0.</li>
</ul>

<p>The trick is in configuring the software correctly *AND* not upgrading
the firmware beyond the build-in v2.2eu as the newer versions tend to
cause more incompatibilities and they donâ€™t add or fix any problems
youâ€™ll have with this configuration. <strong>Stick with firmware v2.2eu.</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Setup your D-Link and connect via the web management interface,
usually found at <a href="http://192.168.0.50">http://192.168.0.50</a></li>
  <li>Navigate your way through the menus to <strong>Home-&gt;Wireless</strong></li>
  <li>Select <strong>Mode: AP Repeater</strong></li>
  <li>Under <strong>Site Survey, hit Scan</strong> to find all the devices on your home
network.</li>
  <li>You should now see your regular home network listed, <strong>select your
network</strong> and you will see the information be copied above into the
â€˜Root AP MAC Addressâ€™ and â€˜SSIDâ€™</li>
  <li><strong>Make sure your Authentication details are identical to your
Homehub</strong>, if theyâ€™re not then it simply wonâ€™t work.</li>
  <li>Select â€˜<strong>Apply</strong>â€™ and then youâ€™re done here</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="2-homehub">2. Homehub</h3>

<ul>
  <li>** atÂ <a href="http://192.168.1.254">http://192.168.1.254</a></li>
  <li>Go through the menus:Â <strong>Advanced -&gt; Configuration -&gt; Wireless -&gt;
Repeater</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Scan for wireless access points</strong> to discover all of the
Accessible Access Points</li>
  <li><strong>Tick the box next to your network</strong> in the Accessible Access
Points list</li>
  <li>Hit <strong>Apply</strong> and thats that.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/assets/img/BT-WifiRepeater.jpg" alt="" title="BT-WifiRepeater" /></p>

<p>Thatâ€™s it, once your devices have rebooted themselves your 2 networks
should be able to see each other. Iâ€™ve done this a few times now and
itâ€™s worked like a charm every time.</p>

<p>This has failed for me if Iâ€™ve tried to change settings or upgrade
firmware (v2.3, v2.4, v2.5) and all have caused me much grief. Stick
with firmware v2.2 and itâ€™s a breeze.</p>

  <li><strong>OPTIONAL - Netgear GS108 8-port Gigabit Hub</strong>
The 2100AP sadly only has 1 network port so youâ€™ll need a little
network hub if you want to connect more than 1 device to the
endpoint.
Iâ€™ve had great success with the small but fast 8-port hub.</li>
