I"I<p>Recently when I was trying to run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">brew update</code> on my Mac I was hitting errors that claimed I had uncommitted changes to my local brew and yet I hadn’t made any changes. It didn’t matter what I did, the changes would not revert and the errors would not go away.</p>
