I"<p>I‚Äôve spent a little while this week whiling away the hours with a couple
of music related apps for iPhone / iPad I‚Äôd recommend you check-out.
Perfect for a Sunday morning.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/mzi.egpepgiv.175x175-754.jpg" alt="" title="mzi.egpepgiv.175x175-75" />I saw
a video of BIT.TRIP being played over on YouTube and it looked exactly
like my kind of game. It look fun and furious with a great graphic style
all of its own. I had to have it!</p>

<blockquote>

move the paddle up and down bouncing beats back from which they came!
