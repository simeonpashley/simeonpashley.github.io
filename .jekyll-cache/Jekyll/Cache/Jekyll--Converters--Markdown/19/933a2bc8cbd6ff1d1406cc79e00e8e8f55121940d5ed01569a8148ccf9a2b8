I"ª<p>I spend a lot of my time keeping in touch with whatâ€™s going off in the
Games Industry and I thought it worthwhile sharingÂ 7 of my favourite
Games Industry <a href="http://blog.gamefreelancing.com/p/what-is-rss.html">RSS</a> Feeds to keep you all up-to-date.</p>

<p>I personally subscribe to these via <a href="http://www.google.com/reader">Google
Reader</a>, which I find to be an excellent way to keep everything in 1 place and really get the most out of my valuable time. Iâ€™d recommend taking this habit up if you havenâ€™t
already.</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="http://www.develop-online.net/" title="Develop Magazine Online">Develop
Online</a> -
This is a little bit of a cheat as Develop splits itâ€™s feeds into 3</li>
</ol>

<p>topics: regular, Blog and Feature so you can choose which is best
for you. I tend to go for all 3 as itâ€™s always a fantastic read and
much of the content appears way ahead of itâ€™s paper variant through
the post. I like seeing people I know with their names up there and
also spotting pictures of them too. 2. <a href="http://www.gamesindustry.biz/" title="GI">GamesIndustry.Biz</a> - This
<strong>used</strong> to be my most visited UK-centric industry feed and it
proudly sat at the top of my Google Reader list. It got bumped down
my list because you now have to register to read full articles,
which you donâ€™t have to on other sites. Itâ€™s still great, just not
as convenient as it used to be. 3. <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/" title="Gamasutra - The Art &amp; Business of Computer Games">Gamasutra</a> -
This was <strong><em>the <span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-style: normal;">game industry web-site a few years ago
as it was pretty much the only one. In addition to itâ€™s US based
news feed, itâ€™s packed full of useful articles, interviews and
reviews of all things to do with game development.</span></span></em></strong> 4. <strong><em><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-style: normal;"><a href="http://www.tipb.com/" title="The iPhone Blog">The iPhone
Blog</a> - in their own words
â€œThe #1 iPhone, iPad and iPod touch blog!â€. Strong words but this
is a useful little site that also sucks in other smartphone info
too. I believe itâ€™s important to always keep your eye on the
periphery to make sure you donâ€™t miss out on
something.</span></span></em></strong> 5. <strong><em><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-style: normal;"><a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/" title="Kotaku">Escapist
Magazine</a> - pretty much
the only popular games feed I read as it tends to have the most
interesting articles, interviews and genuine reviews. I also
regularly visit many of itâ€™s sister sites.</span></span></em></strong> 6. <strong><em><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-style: normal;"><a href="http://blog.eu.playstation.com/" title="PlayStation.Blog (Europe)">PlayStation.Blog
(Europe)</a> -
A blog dedicated to all things specific to PlayStation in Europe,
including specials, interviews, previews and sometimes limited Beta
codes. Again, used to work for Sony Europe so I like to see the
products coming through and the people I know doing
well.</span></span></em></strong> 7. <strong><em><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-style: normal;"><a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/live/engineeringblog/" title="PlayStation.Blog (Europe)">XBox
Engineering</a> -
This feed a little â€˜tech thirstâ€™ for me and itâ€™s a great insight
into some of the tech that MS publish to show â€˜under the hoodâ€™ of
their SDKs.</span></span></em></strong></p>

<p>What about you? Do you have sites that you visit regularly? Have I
missed a â€˜must seeâ€™ site?</p>

<p>Let me know in the comments sections.</p>
