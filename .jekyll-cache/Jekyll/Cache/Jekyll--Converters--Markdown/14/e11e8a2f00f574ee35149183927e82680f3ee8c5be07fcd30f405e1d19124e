I"õ<p>Stress is a fact of 21st-century life, and all the more so when you‚Äôre
working on big, high-pressure projects. I‚Äôve worked in a projects
environment for most of the past 20 years, and I know how it gets. You
start to become irritable, forgetful, you may find yourself dreaming
about work, you‚Äôre tired but you can‚Äôt sleep well, you might even start
to find loud noises and bright lights painful. It‚Äôs not fun.</p>

<p>Basically, what‚Äôs happened is that what is meant to be a short-term
response for getting you out of immediate physical danger, increasing
your concentration and memory and awareness of your environment, has
kept firing off over a long period, and now those exact responses are
getting worn out - as if you‚Äôd kept lifting a weight with the same hand,
over and over, until your muscles get fatigued and stop working
properly.</p>

<p>So what can you do? On the principle that a problem well defined is half
solved, let‚Äôs start with a definition of stress.</p>

<h3 id="what-stress-is">What Stress Is</h3>

<p>This is my simplified version of the Kim-Diamond definition (in <em>Nature
Reviews Neuroscience</em>, 2002). It has three parts.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Something is measurably winding up your physical state.</li>
  <li>You don‚Äôt like it.</li>
  <li>You don‚Äôt feel in control.</li>
</ol>

<p>All three parts are important. If you love riding roller-coasters, for
example, part 2 of the definition isn‚Äôt fulfilled, and even though
you‚Äôre physically stimulated and you‚Äôre not controlling the
roller-coaster, it‚Äôs not (by this definition) stress.</p>

<p>Funny story, by the way. I was talking about stress to the local Rotary
club, and had accidentally left my notes at home. At one point, having
already told them that there were three parts to the definition of
stress, I realised when I was about to give the third part that I
couldn‚Äôt remember what it was. I started in on the sentence
anyhow: ‚ÄúAnd the third part of the definition of stress is‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>

<p>Fortunately, by the time I got that far I‚Äôd remembered it. (Take a look
above at what the third part is and you‚Äôll realise why this gave me a
laugh later on.)</p>

<h3 id="what-you-can-do-about-stress">What You Can Do About Stress</h3>

<p>As I hinted, the definition contains important clues to three ways to
reduce stress. There‚Äôs something we can do about each of the three
parts.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The <strong>physical</strong> approach starts with calming down your body. The
very simplest way to do this is with breathing. After all, you‚Äôre
pretty much guaranteed to be breathing (if you‚Äôre not, you have
worse problems than just stress), and while we can‚Äôt stop breathing
voluntarily, we can consciously control the depth and rhythm of our
breath.The old advice to take a few deep breaths in a stressful
situation works. The reason is that when your body gets into its
‚Äústress mode‚Äù, it starts to breathe shallowly and rapidly. You can
turn that around and feed it back, so that by breathing deeply and
more slowly, you signal the brain to calm down and switch back into
‚Äúmaintenance mode‚Äù, where it can repair itself, digest food and do
all those other useful processes.</p>

    <p>(The parts of the brain that control breathing and the parts that
deal with strong emotion are practically next to each other, along
with the areas that control heartbeat and blood pressure.)</p>

    <p>Other physical calming techniques include progressive muscle
relaxation and meditation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <strong>emotional</strong> approach addresses the fact that you don‚Äôt like
the stress, that you find it unpleasant. There are so many emotional
techniques that I‚Äôm creating a whole course on them (the <a href="http://emotionalcircuitbreaker.com">Emotional
Circuit-Breaker Toolkit</a>), but
here‚Äôs one simple three-step process that works extremely well. It‚Äôs
called the Welcoming Practice.Step 1 is to <strong>become aware of the
location of the emotion in your body</strong>. Something will have
tightened, be vibrating, be warm or cool - you‚Äôll know it almost as
soon as you pay attention to it. Just be aware of it for now. Take
your time.</p>

    <p>Step 2, when you‚Äôre ready for it, is <strong>to name the emotion and
accept its presence</strong>. The form of words I use is ‚ÄúWelcome, anger‚Äù
(or fear or sadness or whatever it is - there may be several
emotions, in which case I welcome each of them by name). Saying the
name sets up a circuit between the inner ‚Äúemotion feeling‚Äù parts of
your brain and the outer ‚Äúword processing‚Äù parts in the cerebral
cortex, and drains off the activation (Liebermann et al.,
<em>Psychological Science</em>, May 2007). ‚ÄúWelcoming‚Äù the emotion (not the
circumstances, by the way, just the emotion) releases your
resistance to it, which is a big part of what is causing the stress.</p>

    <p>Step 3, again when you‚Äôre ready, is to <strong>gently let go of the
emotion and allow it to subside</strong>. In effect, you‚Äôre telling your
brain that the emotion isn‚Äôt needed right now, and so it can go back
to its normal state.</p>

    <p>I used this to great effect not long ago. I was driving along the
road and some idiot in a Mini pulled out from a side road,
completely illegally, right across my path. I braked and swerved and
just managed to avoid a crash. Now, at one time the fright and anger
would have stayed with me for an hour, but by using the Welcoming
Practice, I was fine within a minute or two.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <strong>cognitive</strong> approach emphasises that, while you can‚Äôt always
change the outward situation, you can change the way you think about
it - and that increases your sense of control.Newman &amp; Stone wrote
up an interesting experiment in <em>Annals of Behavioural Medicine</em>,
June 1996. They showed two groups of people the same stressful
silent film, and asked them to make up either a serious narrative
about it (group 1) or a funny narrative (group 2). They had
pre-tested their participants for sense of humour, and had
deliberately put both high-humour and low-humour people in both
groups.
What they found was that, regardless of their score on the
sense-of-humour test, the ‚Äúfunny narrative‚Äù group not only said they
felt better but <em>were less stressed</em>, according to standard physical
tests, than the ‚Äúserious narrative‚Äù group. The film was the same -
only the story they told themselves about it was different.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>So there are three approaches to reducing stress. Whether you coach
yourself to physically relax, shift your emotional state, or change how
you think about the situation, by using these practices you reduce harm
to your body and mind and put yourself more in control.</p>
