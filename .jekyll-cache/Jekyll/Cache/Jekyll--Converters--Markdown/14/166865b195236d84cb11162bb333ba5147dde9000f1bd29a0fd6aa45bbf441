I"É<p>I very recently wrote a post entitled â€˜<a href="http://pashley.org/2010/08/why-does-redundancy-happens-in-game-development.html">Why Does Redundancy Always
Happen In Game
Development?</a>â€™ that kinda hit the spot with a few people and I think it needs more context so I thought it worthwhile giving a separate update.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s a tough topic to discuss and it always has
negativeÂ connotationsÂ but itâ€™s a fact of life and ignoring it and not
being prepared is a bad thing.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gamesbrief.com/joblosstracker/"><img src="/assets/Screen-shot-2010-09-03-at-16.14.14-150x116.png" alt="GamesBrief Job Loss Tracker -

Redundancy is obviously a real and horrible event that happens and it can be mitigated by properly running a business but itâ€™s largely inevitable.</p>

<p>My recent experience is based around running mid to large-scale teams of
30-80 people across multiple projects and the level of commitment that
goes with that. My focus is on quality, delivery and profitability of
all the work I do. The original post was intended to make people aware
of the fact that if they do not consider what happens at the end of a
project and blindly go off on a creative whim then donâ€™t be surprised if
your business fails. This is obviously fine if youâ€™re motives are purely
hobbyist and you never intended to be a business, or stay really small
anyway.</p>

<p>Outside of the hobby developers making video games is an â€œindustryâ€
about making money, for which you need to â€œshift boxesâ€. As much as we
like to think weâ€™re being totally creative, most people in video games
only do this so they can pay their bills. After all, we all need to live
somewhere and pay for food for which we need money, that we get from
making games, that people buy.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s actually a â€œbox shifting creative industryâ€, I completely support
that as itâ€™s ultimately creativity that sells games and the 2 are
intrinsically linked. There is 1 more important criteria though, which
is quality. Quality sells games like hot cakes and there are many
factors towards driving quality upwards. Oh, and marketing, good
marketing will sell the most un-creative/poor quality things as Iâ€™m sure
youâ€™ve witnessed. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExWfh6sGyso">Oh and the
aqueducts</a>. :)</p>

<p>During my career I have seen all the problems occur in business time and
time again from big businesses through to small businesses, Iâ€™ve
occasionally been part of the mess and more frequently seen others get
caught up in the demise of a company. In pretty much all of these cases
itâ€™s been avoidable.</p>

<p>Businesses, regardless of what theyâ€™re doing, need to be agile and able
to cope with the ebb and flow of the demands during the production
lifecycle. Smart use of outsourcing, freelance / contract staff in the
right place and prove fruitful and help youâ€™re business remain stable
and able to weather the storm. I have strived to ensure that projects
and I run and businesses Iâ€™m involved with consider this and mitigate
the risk of redundancy where possible.</p>

<p>Thankfully, redundancy always presents new opportunities and itâ€™s time
to pick yourself up and get back on the horse. After all, what doesnâ€™t
kill you only makes you stronger.</p>
