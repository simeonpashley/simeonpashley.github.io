I"¼<p>I think thereâ€™s a missed opportunity with Episodic games that are
currently being launched, theyâ€™re largely just about delivering a known
experience over an extended period of time and splitting the costs
throughout each episode.</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s very little focus on the user experience and, more importantly,
the social experience that episodic content can repeatedly deliver.</p>

<p>I think they key to this is engaging everyone in a simultaneous and
recurring experience, like a TV show.</p>

<p>Imagine a chapter of a story driven game like Halo Reach being made
available for everyone to play at 8pm on the 1st Sunday of every month,
just one chapter, no-one can play it before that time so everyone
experiences the same event. It could even be that this chapter is only
available to play for a fixed period too, if you missed the event then
youâ€™ve got to wait for a repeat or get yourself the box-set.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/TVSchedule1.jpg" alt="" title="TVSchedule" /></p>

<p>I believe this will generate much more exposure for the game where the
anticipation of whatâ€™s in the episode and the discussions afterwards
make for a continued presence in peoples minds. Everyone would get the
time to savour the experience and look forwards to the next one, hoping
to share this with your friends.</p>

<p>A great side-effect of this is that it enables others to join the
experience and catch-up with the previous episodes with everyone lining
up at the next event.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s completely important to give people and end-to-end experience,
i.e., a boxed off series with a compelling series ending. This gives
everyone something to share and builds to a great crescendo for your
idea.</p>

<h3 id="how-would-you-make-this-happen">How would you make this happen?</h3>

<p>I believe that a pre-sold box set, either retail or online, would enable
players to get their content ready *before* the content is unlocked at
a specific time. You have the content in your hands, itâ€™s ready, you
know itâ€™s going to be delivered to you over time so you can judge the
value.</p>

<p>This is a different position to making the game available for
download/purchase at a set time, this is about unlocking the experience.</p>

<p>iTunes has incorporated the idea of a â€˜<strong>Series Pass</strong>â€™ for TV Series
since 2006 with the exact model with series such as The Inbetweeners
being unlocked as theyâ€™re aired on TV. It would seem likely that this
model will extend to games too.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/Screen-shot-2010-10-03-at-14.04.20.jpg" alt="" title="Screen-shot-2010-10-03-at-14.04.20" /></p>

<p>Steam have also been supporting this kind of pre-load and unlock for
years where they pre-download content to your PC so that the game is
ready to play at a specific time, no additional downloads or waiting is
necessary.</p>

<p>For other platforms, it would seem trivial to unlock the content based
on a live connection to an â€˜unlock serverâ€™ instead of the obvious
unlocking at a set time based on your PC/phone/console clock.</p>

<h3 id="bonus-extras">Bonus Extras</h3>

<p>Thereâ€™s also the opportunity to engage your audience between events by
adding in the usual layers of Making Of documentaries and Developer
Commentary (Valve have been <a href="http://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Commentary_System">embedding
comments</a> this since 2005). These extras could be made available to series subscribers to encourage people to take up the whole package.</p>

<h3 id="benefits-to-your-business">Benefits to your business</h3>

<p>There is a middle-ground to be had here. As a business you could make
enough content to release but the whole series would be incomplete as
youâ€™d be making the later episodes as you go along.</p>

<p>There are pros &amp; cons to this approach.</p>

<p>It means you *have* to hit all of your production dates for the later
episodes or you risk breaking the series and therefore the experience
and we all know thereâ€™s a lot of things that can go wrong. This risk is
mitigated by the length of your series and the lead time on your
episode, i.e., if you get 6 months worth of content in the bank before
you release the 1st episode then youâ€™re probably going to be OK.</p>

<p>One benefit to overlapping release &amp; development is that you can start
to incorporate feedback into your episodes that are currently in
production and also use the revenue to keep your business going.</p>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>

<p>I believe thereâ€™s a great opportunity for well thought out and
specifically written games that maximise the potential of Episodic
content.</p>

<p>It needs a well written story that spans multiple episodes with the
emotional peaks &amp; troughs to keep you coming back for more.</p>

<p>All of the pieces have existed for a while but no-ones really made a go
of it and I believe that the synced mass shared event is key to this.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s not enough simply to make your game available to download at a
fixed time, the experience must be shared.</p>
