I",<p>I wanted to share with you a presentation about <strong>Where The Money Goes</strong>
that is received from making video games. I made this presentation a few
years ago to a game development studio I was running at the time and I
believe everyone found it useful and gained a better understanding of
where the money that comes into the business goes before it pays their
wages and why ‘when’ it comes in is important too. I’ve updated this
post since then with more up-to-date principles, information and costs
as I learn new things ever day.</p>
