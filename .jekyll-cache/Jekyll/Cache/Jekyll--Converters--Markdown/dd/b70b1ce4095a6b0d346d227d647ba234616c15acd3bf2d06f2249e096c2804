Over the years I've found that RSS feeds have made it easier for me to
keep up the latest news in my reading list. I have a carefully
cultivated list of 200+ home &amp; work related feeds that I patrol every
day. Here's how to import my list for your own use.

<div>

The imminent demise of Google Reader on 1st June 2013 has prompted me to
find an alternative reader. To be safe I exported my reading list in
[OPML format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPML)so I could take it with me (linked to this post).

<h2 id="how-can-i-use-your-reading-list">How can I use your reading list?</h2>

<p>Since most RSS readers sync with <em>Google Reader</em> you can use that as a
way to get the feed setup. After which you can sync it with your
favourite reader of choice</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s a quick way to use my feeds as a starting point:

settings" /></p>

<ol>
  <li>Download my reading list in OPML format -Â <a href="http://db.tt/Sad7oSAT">http://db.tt/Sad7oSAT</a></li>
  <li>Open <em>Google Reader</em> - <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/reader">http://www.google.co.uk/reader</a></li>
  <li>Go to <em>Reader Settings</em> (via the little cog at the top right of the
<em>Google Reader</em> window)</li>
  <li>Find the <em>Import/Export</em>Â tab in settings,Â then import my OPML file
you downloaded earlier</li>
</ol>

<div>

<div>

After much investigation I chose [Feedly](http://www.feedly.com/) as my weapon of choice.

</div>

Feedly gives me everything I need for my reading list between browser &amp;
mobile in a clean, elegant way. _Feedly_ enables me to send posts to
_Pocket_ too where I can read &amp; share them at my leisure. I often patrol
the headlines and my iPhone and then send interesting posts to _Pocket_
where I can read them in comfort on my laptop or tablet.

**How do I import into Feedly?**

</div>

<div>

It really couldn't be simpler as you don't have to import anything!

</div>

<div>

1.  Go toÂ *Feedly*, register and connect to your account to _Google
    Reader_ -Â Â &lt;http://www.feedly.com/&gt;
2.  *Feedly*Â will import all the feeds

</div>

<div>

That's it.Â **Stick withÂ *Feedly***Â as it supports 'Send toÂ **Pocket**'

</div>

<div>

Obviously my feeds will only get you started as there's probably a lot
of stuff in there you're never going to read but it's a start. :)

</div>

<div>

You can also install aÂ *Feedly*Â plugin for
[Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/feedly/) &amp;
[Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/feedly-your-news-rss-goog/hipbfijinpcgfogaopmgehiegacbhmob?hl=en) that makes curating your feeds ever so easy.

</div>

<div>

**Boom!**Â You now have an awesome easy way to keep up-to-date with
everything that's going on around your favourite websites.
