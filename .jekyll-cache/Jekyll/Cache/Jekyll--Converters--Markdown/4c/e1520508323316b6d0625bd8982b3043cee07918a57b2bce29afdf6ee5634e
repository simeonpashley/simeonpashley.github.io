and mobile web viewing are increasing every day and itâ€™s simply not good
enough to expect users to view your regular site. iPhone, Android and
tablet viewers expect custom built views.</p>

<p>Thankfully, all of our regular and content-managed websites <strong>take full
advantage of the iPhone, iPad, Android and other devices</strong> with views
and touch-based interfaces especially built to get the most out of them.</p>

<p>Our new elegant iPad specific view is a joy to behold and features large
buttons, swipe gestures and much more.</p>

<p><strong>Can you afford not to have a mobile website?</strong> Especially a <strong>FREE</strong>
version of your existing site?</p>
