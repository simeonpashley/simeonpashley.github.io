I"d<p>In 2008, Gladwell’s book <em>“Outliers: The Story of Success”</em> repeatedly mentions the “10,000-Hour Rule”, claiming that the key to success in any field is, to a large extent, a matter of practicing a specific task for a total of around 10,000 hours. This equates to 1,250 working days, or 5 working years of focus on your core skill.</p>
