I"<p>My Macbook Pro was recently suffering from 100% CPU pretty much all of the time and it took quite a while to solve them problem and breathe life back into my workhorse.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> Disable <em>Little Snitch</em> status in menu bar.</p>

<p>My Macbook Pro seems to be suffering from high <em>WindowServer</em> CPU use when my machine isn’t really doing anything.</p>

<p>NOTE: During my investigations it appears that <em>WindowServer</em> CPU typically rises when something on your toolbar updates often.</p>

<p>Here are the things I’ve tried, some of which come from other solutions posted around the web:</p>

<h3 id="reduce-transparency-effects">Reduce transparency effects</h3>

<p>(in System Preferences &gt; Accessibility under Display).</p>

<p>This is the most highly reported solution to the problem but this didn’t do anything for me.</p>

<h3 id="switch-displays-have-separate-spaces-off">Switch “Displays have separate Spaces off”</h3>

<p>(in System Preferences &gt; Mission Control).</p>

<p>Switch Dashboard off. I don’t use Spaces so this didn’t do anything.</p>

<h3 id="fix-disk-permissions-reset-system-management-controller-reset-pram">Fix disk permissions, reset System Management Controller, reset PRAM</h3>

<p>(https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6623697). Sadly, this did nothing but then again I do things like this as periodic maintenance.</p>

<h3 id="switch-off-automatic-graphic-switching">Switch off automatic graphic switching</h3>

<p>(System Preferences &gt; Energy Saver).
This only applies to systems with a dual GPU such as the higher end Macbook Pro 15” upwards.</p>

<h3 id="turn-off-skype">Turn off Skype</h3>

<p>For me, Skype continues to be a constant drain on CPU performance and shutting it down did reduce CPU usage <strong>but</strong> this was it’s own CPU usage, not <em>WindowServer</em> CPU.</p>

<h3 id="dont-show-seconds-on-clock">Don’t show seconds on clock</h3>

<p>(System Preferences &gt; Date &amp; Time &gt; Display the time with seconds)
Reducing the amount of menu status bar update seems to general reduce load on <em>WindowServer</em></p>

<h3 id="turn-off-little-snitch">Turn off Little Snitch</h3>

<p>Turning off the <em>Little Snitch</em> option <em>Show status In menu bar</em> massively reduced the WindowServer load for me!</p>

<p>Interestingly there’s a note in their Beta channel about something related. I guess this could be causing the high load on <em>WindowServer</em> too:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When using OS X Mavericks (10.9) or later, Little Snitch Agent, Network Monitor, and Configuration should not cause the discrete GPU (“High Performance GPU”) to be activated anymore, especially on Mid 2010 MacBook Pro.</p>
